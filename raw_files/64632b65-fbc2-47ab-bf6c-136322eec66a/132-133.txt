(ConEd), KeySpan Gas East Corporation (KEDLI), The Brooklyn Union Gas Company (KEDNY), National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (NFG), New York State Electric  &amp; Gas Corporation (NYSEG), Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation d/b/a National Grid (Niagara Mohawk), Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&amp;R), and Rochester Gas and Electric  Corporation (RG&amp;E) (collectively, the gas utilities) to administer gas energy  efficiency portfolios  beginning January 1, 2016. The Commission also directs ConEd, KEDLI, KEDNY, NFG, NYSEG, Niagara Mohawk, and RG&amp;E to file tariffs to institute an electric  and/or gas Energy  Efficiency Tracker to recover the costs of implementing   energy  efficiency programs beginning on<page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> January 1, 2016.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">BACKGROUND</emphasis></h><p>New York State's Energy  Efficiency Portfolio  Standard (EEPS) was established in 2007 <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_12_107_72"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> Case 07-M-0548, <emphasis typeStyle="un">Proceeding on Motion of the Commission Regarding an Energy  Efficiency Portfolio  Standard</emphasis>, Order Instituting Proceeding (issued May 16, 2007).</p></bodyText></footnote> and is in its final year of authorization.  Under EEPS, utility efficiency programs have typically been resource acquisition  programs, oriented toward direct rebates and subsidies to encourage individual customers  to employ more efficient end-use equipment and systems, thereby acquiring energy savings  as a resource. In a February 26, 2015 order, the Commission adopted a regulatory policy framework and implementation plan for a reformed retail electric  industry in its Reforming the Energy  Vision (REV) proceeding, <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_12_128_58"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-M-0101, <emphasis typeStyle="un">Proceeding on Motion of the Commission in Regard to Reforming the Energy  Vision</emphasis>, Order Adopting Regulatory Policy Framework and Implementation Plan (issued February 26, 2015) (February REV Order or REV Order).</p></bodyText></footnote> taking steps to reorient the electric  industry and the ratemaking paradigm toward a consumer-centered approach that harnesses technology and markets. As part of that reform, the Commission established a new framework for the energy  efficiency programs of investor-owned electric  utilities. The Commission increased electric  utilities' responsibility for electric energy  efficiency programs beginning in 2016 and directed electric  utilities to begin using more market-based  approaches to drive greater value for customers.  During subsequent years, the electric <page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> utilities' energy  efficiency portfolios  will gradually evolve to align with REV approaches and the new market transformation  focus of the New York State Energy  Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The Commission also stated that rather than funding  efficiency programs through a surcharge,  programs will be integrated into electric  utilities' businesses and costs will be recovered through rates like other components of the revenue requirement.</p><p>The new framework initiated in the February REV Order provides electric  utilities with more flexibility  in designing and managing their programs within authorized portfolio <page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/>  budgets,  as opposed to specific program authorizations,  to achieve energy  efficiency objectives in support of overall REV outcomes through the use of new and innovative approaches. With this flexibility,   electric  utilities should develop programs that are more market-based  and include market mechanisms that combine resource acquisition  with third-party activities to drive greater value for customers,  achieve greater market-wide efficiency savings,   target  specific system needs, and depend less on direct ratepayer support.</p><p>Although the new framework provides increased flexibility  for electric  utilities in the design and implementation of their portfolios,  the Commission directed Department of Public Service Staff (Staff), in consultation  with the E&lt;2&gt; Working Group, to develop a REV Energy  Efficiency Best Practices Guide outlining energy  efficiency best practices under a REV framework, to ensure shared learning and the evolution of programs across service territories. The Commission required the first version of the Guide to be filed with the Secretary by February 1, 2016 and for it to include a process for revisions and updates such that information in the guide changes with the pace<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> of technology and Commission directives.</p><p>In addition, the Commission required the electric  utilities to include a Self-Direct  Program in their electric   energy  efficiency portfolios  no later than January 1, 2017 allowing large commercial and industrial   customers  to self-direct  funds that would otherwise support the utilities' portfolios.  The Commission directed Staff and the electric  utilities to work in consultation  with the large commercial and industrial   customers  to develop guidance regarding Self-Direct  programs to be filed with the Secretary by August 3, 2015.</p><p>With respect to low-income   energy  efficiency programs, the Commission stated that NYSERDA would remain the default provider of low-income  programs, but encouraged electric  utilities to develop innovative programs to expand the reach of measures that include energy  efficiency within low-income  communities, in concert with and not in competition with efforts of NYSERDA and private market activity.</p><p>For planning  purposes, the Commission directed the E&lt;2&gt; Working Group to establish a three-year  rolling cycle,  to be filed by May 1, 2015, whereby on an annual  basis, the Commission will approve the addition of a third year of energy <page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> efficiency funding  and metrics,  providing at least two years of market certainty and avoiding "cliff" years such as 2015. As part of the three-year  rolling cycle,  the Commission directed electric  utilities to file, on an annual  basis for Commission approval, an Energy  Efficiency Budget  and Metrics  Plan containing proposed portfolio   budgets  and metrics  on a three-year  rolling cycle,  and Energy  Efficiency Transition  Implementation Plans (ETIPs) as companion filings to the proposed portfolio   Budget  and Metrics  Plan to inform  the authorization  of such budgets  and metrics,  but not subject to Commission approval. The Commission directed Staff to develop ETIP Guidance, in consultation  with the E&lt;2&gt; Working Group, to be filed with the Secretary by May 1, 2015, outlining the elements to be included in ETIPs. In addition to an annual  date by which electric  utilities will file proposed portfolio   budgets  and metrics  and ETIPs, the Commission required that the three-year   cycle  include: an annual  date by which evaluation studies of programs in previous cycles  shall be filed in order to inform  overall program design and operation and an updated Technical Resource Manual (TRM); an annual  date by <page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> which an updated TRM will be filed to inform  the preparation of electric  utility Budget  and Metrics  Plans and ETIP filings; and an annual   target  date for Commission authorization  of electric  utility portfolio   budgets  and metrics  for the next three-year  program cycle. </p><p>To initiate the first iteration of the three-year   cycle,  the Commission authorized electric   portfolio   budgets  and metrics  for 2016 at the 2015 levels, required electric  utilities to propose budgets  and metrics  for the remaining years of the 2016 - 2018 cycle  in a Budget  and Metrics  Plan by July 1, 2015, and to file, as a companion filing, proposed 2016 - 2018 ETIPs to inform  consideration of the proposed budgets  and metrics. </p><p>In addition to granting increased flexibility,  the Commission assigned increased responsibility to the electric  utilities in the administration of their energy  efficiency portfolios.  The Commission also required electric  utilities, as a unified group, to maintain their own planning,  evaluation, TRM, and benefit/cost analysis tools, to be uniform across the State to the extent possible, and noted that Staff would maintain a monitoring and auditing role. The Commission directed electric  utilities to <page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> design and implement Evaluation, Measurement &amp; Verification  (EM&amp;V) activities that will yield timely information to be incorporated into the annual  iterations of utility programs, resource manuals, and guidance, and stated that it was the electric  utilities' responsibility to ensure that EM&amp;V activities are planned to be used and useful and coordinated with NYSERDA EM&amp;V activities to avoid duplicative efforts. The Commission directed a review and revision of current evaluation guidelines (that is, the New York Evaluation Plan Guidance for EEPS Program Administrators), as well as data tracking obligations and reporting requirements, to be undertaken in 2015.</p><p>The REV Order directed the electric  utilities to work collectively to support the maintenance of a New York StateTRM and to file a TRM Management Plan by no later than June 1, 2015, at which time the electric  utilities would assume responsibility for the TRM from Staff. The Commission required the plan to include a process ensuring each utility's and NYSERDA's input is considered, all changes to the TRM are transparent to Staff and stakeholders,  and an updated TRM will be filed annually.</p><p>Noting that a new Benefit Cost Analysis <page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> (BCA) framework will be developed under REV that will eventually apply to energy  efficiency and other distributed energy  resources, the Commission retained the total resource cost (TRC) test as the primary benefit cost analysis tool for energy  efficiency. While encouraging electric  utilities to apply the TRC at varying levels of granularity, the Commission required the TRC to exceed 1.0 at the portfolio  level.</p><p>In the REV Order, the Commission stated that a different approach from that used for direct subsidies was required to measure the success of market-based  approaches and market transformation  programs, adding that market penetration rates and other indices of market transformation  should be considered to measure the true value of customer-funded efficiency efforts. The REV Order therefore directed electric  utilities to develop and propose metrics  applicable to market transformation  strategies, in consultation  with Staff and NYSERDA.</p><p>To support a smooth and effective transition  to the new regulatory framework for electric  utility energy  efficiency programs beyond 2015, the Commission authorized additional flexibility  during the final year of EEPS in the REV Order. That flexibility <page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> included the ability to use EEPS electric  EM&amp;V funds for activities in support of planning  and implementation of post-2015 electric   energy  efficiency programs, to use uncommitted electric  EM&amp;V funds for electric  program costs where there is not viable option of transferring budgets  and targets  from within the portfolio,  and allow EEPS electric  program and EM&amp;V funds that are unspent as of December 31, 2015 to be retained by the electric  utility to reduce the revenue requirement associated with post-2015 electric   energy  efficiency programs.</p><p>Although the REV Order addressed the energy  efficiency programs of electric  utilities, the Commission stated that utilities should be prepared to implement 2016 natural gas   energy  efficiency portfolios  and propose budgets  and metrics  for a three-year   cycle  pursuant to the same approach as taken with the electric   portfolios. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE MAKING</emphasis></h><p>A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) concerning utility gas energy  efficiency programs, targets,   budgets  and administration under consideration here was published in the <emphasis typeStyle="un">State Register</emphasis> on March 18, 2015 (SAPA 07-M-0548SP81). The proposed rulemaking would authorize the implementation of<page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> gas energy  efficiency programs beginning in 2016 for Central Hudson, ConEd, KEDLI, KEDNY, NFG, NYSEG, Niagara Mohawk, O&amp;R and RG&amp;E under the same framework established in the February 26, 2015 REV Order for the implementation of electric   energy  efficiency programs beginning in 2016 and authorize the same flexibility  during the final year of EEPS for gas utilities implementing   energy  efficiency programs under EEPS as that granted to the electric  utilities in the REV Order. The minimum time period for the receipt of public comments pursuant to the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA) regarding that notice expired on May 4, 2015. Comments generally in favor of the authorization  of gas energy  efficiency programs under the proposed framework were received from NFG, the Joint Utilities (JU), Corning Natural Gas  Corporation (Corning), Advanced Energy  Economy Institute (AEEI), and the Association of Energy  Affordability (AEA). A summary of the comments related to the NOPR is attached as Appendix A. To the extent comments are relevant to the actions taken in this Order, they are addressed below.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">DISCUSSION</emphasis></h><p>The Commission approves the implementation of natural gas   energy  efficiency<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> programs beginning in 2016 under the same framework as that established in the February REV Order for the implementation of electric   energy  efficiency programs, with the modifications  discussed herein, for Central Hudson, ConEd, KEDLI, KEDNY, NFG, NYSEG, Niagara Mohawk, O&amp;R, and RG&amp;E.</p><p>In its REV Order, the Commission noted that "although REV concentrates on the electric  industry, it is our expectation that utilities will also continue and evolve their gas energy  efficiency efforts." <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_31_812_57"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> REV Order at 79.</p></bodyText></footnote> As the REV Order focused on the electric  industry and the integration of energy  efficiency efforts into utility system planning,  some aspects of the REV Order, notably the use of electric energy  efficiency measures in demand reduction efforts, do not apply to the gas industry. While parties generally agree that market-based  approaches have potential, most parties recommend the continuation of current gas energy  efficiency programs to maintain the current levels of energy  efficiency. AEEI urges the Commission to allow its new policies to be tested by balancing new approaches with existing programs. Market-based  approaches and market transformation  strategies, however, can and should be applied to gas<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/>energy  efficiency efforts. Gas utilities, like electric  utilities, are therefore expected to use new and innovative approaches, including those that are more market-based  in their energy  efficiency efforts, and introduce market mechanisms that combine resource acquisition  with third party activities in order to increase the reach of their programs and the market penetration of efficiency measures, thereby achieving greater market-wide efficiency savings  with less need for direct ratepayer support. To measure the success of these new approaches, gas utilities are directed to work with electric  utilities in the development and proposal of metrics  applicable to market transformation  strategies, in consultation  with Staff and NYSERDA.</p><p>Gas utilities will be afforded the same flexibility  as that granted to electric  utilities to design and manage their programs within authorized portfolio   budgets,  as opposed to specific program authorizations.  The importance of shared learning in the evolution of programs<page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> across service territories without specific program authorizations  is not limited to electric   energy  efficiency efforts. The Commission therefore directs Staff to include gas energy  efficiency best practices in the REV Energy  Efficiency Best Practices Guide being developed in consultation  with the E&lt;2&gt; Working Group for filing by February 1, 2016.</p><p>With respect to the implementation of low-income  gas efficiency programs, the Commission reiterates its continued commitment to funding  these programs where market participation is not a viable option. AEA comments that utilities play an important role in providing energy  efficiency services to low-income   customers  and it supports the coordination of efforts as opposed to competition between utilities and NYSERDA. As with electric   low-income  efficiency programs, NYSERDA will remain the default provider of low-income  gas efficiency programs. Gas utilities are encouraged to develop innovative programs to expand the reach of energy  efficiency measures within low-income  communities that are complementary to, and not in competition, with NYSERDA's efforts.</p><p>AEEI proposes a five-year transition  framework for implementation in parallel to existing<page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> incentive and resource acquisition  programs to prevent backsliding on energy  efficiency goals, and states that existing programs can be phased out when there is evidence that market-based  programs will perform better. The Commission finds that the administration of gas energy  efficiency programs should align with that of electric  efficiency programs and will therefore require gas utilities to implement their efficiency programs under the same framework as that established in the REV Order for electric  programs. To that end, gas utilities will annually file a Budget  and Metrics  Plan, as well as ETIPs, <footnote><anchor id="fnote4_35_981_33"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p> Gas utility ETIP filings shall comply with the ETIP Guidance filed by Staff in Case 15-M-0252 on June 1, 2015, as well as any future modifications  to that guidance.</p></bodyText></footnote> on a three-year  rolling cycle.  To initiate the first three-year cycle,  existing gas energy  efficiency budgets  and targets  will be maintained for 2016 to avoid market disruption and backsliding (see Appendix B). AEA states that the Commission should clarify the targets  to be a floor and not a ceiling while AEEI argues that the targets  for 2016 function as both a floor and a ceiling as there is no way for utilities to recover costs associated with achieving efficiency gains beyond the target.  NFG objects to holding budgets  and targets  flat for 2016, and suggests that utilities be given<page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> the opportunity to propose budgets  and targets  for 2016 as part of their ETIP filings, stating that this approach would neither delay ETIP submittals nor cause market disruption and backsliding. The Commission clarifies here that the savings targets  are not a ceiling and the increased flexibility  granted to utilities in the implementation of their programs provides the opportunity to optimize the cost-effectiveness of their portfolios,  thereby providing utilities the ability to achieve more savings  with their authorized portfolio budgets.  Gas utilities implementing energy  efficiency programs in 2016 are directed to propose budgets  and metrics  for the remaining years of the 2016 - 2018 cycle  in an Energy  Efficiency Budget  and Metric  Plan by July 15, 2015. Gas utilities should submit proposed 2016 - 2018 ETIPs as separate, but companion, filings by the same date. For subsequent years, gas utilities will comply with the filing dates established in the Three-Year  Rolling Program Cycle  filed by the E&lt;2&gt; Working Group on May 1, 2015 in Case 15-M-0252, as well as any future modifications  to that cycle. </p><p><page number="17" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/></p><p>The flexibility  afforded under the new framework necessitates that gas utilities assume the same additional responsibility for their portfolios'  performance as was required of the electric  utilities in the REV Order. AEA supports the transition  of responsibility of program implementation and verification  tools from Staff to the utilities but states that the process for their development and adoption must include stakeholder  participation and Commission review and approval. AEA specifically calls out the development of the BCA tools as an area that can be quite controversial and should be determined in a public forum. The annual  approval of utility energy  efficiency portfolio   budgets  and metrics,  which will be based on the verification  tools developed and maintained by the utilities, with Staff oversight, will include a stakeholder  process. If Staff determines that the utilities are not appropriately developing and maintaining the necessary verification  tools, the Commission may reconsider the process by which these tools are managed.</p><p>Gas utilities are therefore instructed to participate with the electric  utilities in the maintenance of utility evaluation, Technical Resource Manual, <page number="18" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> and benefit/cost analysis tools. Gas utility EM&amp;V activities shall be designed to yield timely information to be incorporated into the annual  iterations of gas programs, resource manuals, and guidance, and should be complementary, not duplicative, of NYSERDA EM&amp;V activities. The activities must inform  improvement to individual utility efficiency efforts as well as be shared and integrated in order to improve the accuracy and reliability of foundational tools, such as the TRM. Together with the electric  utilities, gas utilities implementing   energy  efficiency programs will be responsible for ensuring that utility EM&amp;V activities are planned to be used and useful and are coordinated with NYSERDA to avoid duplicative efforts. The gas utilities implementing  efficiency programs in 2016 are directed to participate in the review and revision of current evaluation guidelines (that is, the New York Evaluation Plan Guidance for EEPS Program Administrators), as well as data tracking obligations and reporting requirements, to be undertaken in 2015.</p><p>In addition, as the New York TRM is an integral tool in the management of energy  efficiency portfolios,  the responsibility for its maintenance should<page number="19" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> be borne by all utilities offering efficiency programs. Therefore, despite NFG's recommendation that gas utilities not be required to assume the responsibility for the TRM, the Commission directs all gas utilities implementing   energy  efficiency programs in 2016 to participate in the maintenance of the TRM and further directs the TRM Management Plan filed on June 1, 2015 in Case 15-M-0252 to be modified to reflect this directive.</p><p>As noted in the REV Order, a new BCA framework will be developed under REV that will eventually apply to energy  efficiency. The development of the new BCA framework will include stakeholder  participation and be conducted in a public forum. The Commission anticipates this new BCA framework will be designed to apply to electric   energy  efficiency programs and where necessary be modified to apply to gas energy  efficiency programs. Until this new BCA framework is in place, the total resource cost (TRC) test will be retained for gas energy  efficiency programs, and although utilities are encouraged to apply the TRC at varying levels of granularity, gas utility portfolios  will be required to exceed a TRC of 1.0.</p><p>The Commission will not require gas energy  efficiency<page number="20" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/>  portfolios  to include Self-Direct  programs for large commercial and industrial   customers  at this time. Self-Direct  programs are just now being developed for electric   customers  to be implemented no later than January 1, 2017. Self-Direct  programs for electric   customers  are not new, but as NFG notes the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) is not aware of the provision of natural gas   Self-Direct  programs. Developing and implementing  these programs for electric   customers  will result in useful experience and insights that can inform  consideration of such programs for large commercial and industrial  gas customers.  As stated by NFG at this time, utilities can work directly with large commercial and industrial  gas customers  to design programs that suit those customers'  needs.</p><p>The Commission finds merit with the objections raised by NFG regarding moving away from identifiable surcharges  for program support and AEA's comment that the Commission has not clarified how it intends to reconcile moving away from identifiable surcharges  with its proposal for a Self-Direct  program. Therefore, only costs associated with utility personnel working directly on energy  efficiency programs<page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> should be recovered through base rates. Electric  and gas utilities implementing energy  efficiency programs in 2016 are therefore directed to file tariffs to institute an Energy  Efficiency Tracker (EE Tracker) as a surcharge  mechanism for cost recovery of the remaining costs associated with the implementation of energy  efficiency programs within 30 days of the issuance of this Order. <footnote><anchor id="fnote5_42_1307_126"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>Central Hudson and O&amp;R are exempt from this requirement as EE Trackers are being instituted for both companies on a different schedule in compliance with their respective rate proceedings.</p></bodyText></footnote> Until such time as internal labor costs associated with energy  efficiency are included in the base rates of a utility through a rate proceeding, the EE Tracker may be designed to cover those costs as well. On an annual  basis, each utility will reconcile actual recoveries with allowed budgets.  Recovering costs associated with the implementation of energy  efficiency programs through an EE tracker should ameliorate concerns regarding transparency and enable the implementation of Self-Direct  programs for large commercial and industrial electric customers  which depend on the ability to identify specific customer  support for efficiency programs.</p><p><page number="22" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/></p><p>To support a smooth and effective transition  from EEPs to the framework established here for gas energy  efficiency programs post-2015, the Commission will authorize the same flexibility,  listed below, during the final year of EEPS for gas utilities as that granted to electric  utilities in the REV Order.<excerpt><bodyText><p>. EEPS gas EM&amp;V funds may be used for activities in support of planning  and implementation of post-2015 gas energy  efficiency programs. Emphasis should be placed on the ability to obtain results in a timely fashion to support the overall cycle  of improving guidance documents, e.g., TRM, BCA, REV Energy  Efficiency Best Practices Guide. To aide in the more timely completion of EM&amp;V work, Staff will continue to serve as a valuable resource to the gas utilities in the conduct of the work but we will not require Staff approval. With this additional level of streamlining, the gas utilities accept a higher level of responsibility for ensuring the quality and timely completion of the final work product. All final EM&amp;V reports should be filed upon their completion with the Secretary. Staff will maintain a monitoring role and audit function to verify the use of EM&amp;V results in future program<page number="23" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> planning. </p><p>. To the extent EEPS 2 gas program(s) are experiencing demand that exceeds the available budget (s), and a gas utility does not have a viable option of transferring budget/ target  from within its portfolio,  uncommitted EEPS EM&amp;V funds may be used for this purpose, with the understanding that a corresponding increase in energy  savings  targets  will be calculated based on an "as-ordered" $/Dth basis.</p><p>.

PUC LEXIS 263"/> omitted from consideration to implement energy  efficiency beginning in 2016 in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. No objections were raised concerning this omission. Corning and St. Lawrence will therefore not be required to implement energy  efficiency programs beyond December 31, 2015. The Commission will not decide on the disposition of potential unexpended EEPS funds here. Any unexpended EEPS funds remaining at the end of 2015 for both Corning and St. Lawrence shall be addressed in the next rate proceeding for each company.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">SEQRA FINDINGS</emphasis></h><p>Pursuant to our responsibilities under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), in conjunction with this Order, the Commission finds that programs modified here are within the overall action previously examined in Case 07-M-0548 and will not result in any different environmental impact than that previously examined.

AEEI supports the development of regulatory policies and the Commission's desire to implement new methods to promote energy  efficiency, but urges the Commission to strike the appropriate balance between existing and proposed policy to allow new policies to be tested without jeopardizing proven programs that deliver significant value to customers.  AEEI expressed<page number="27" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> concern that without the interventions provided by existing programs energy  efficiency will be significantly underutilized as a resource. AEEI continues that although the proposed policy transitions  energy  efficiency programs over three years, targets  have only been set for one, and those targets  not only serve as a floor or minimum, but also as a ceiling as there is no way for utilities to recover the costs incurred to achieve savings  beyond that floor. AEEI adds that although it understands the role of NYSERDA to be changing, NYSERDA programs are currently responsible for the majority of energy  efficiency savings  across the state and thus it is essential that these savings  be maintained at current levels during the transition.  AEEI comments that there are many market failures and barriers to customers  purchasing efficiency upgrades and adjusting their behavior, and energy  savings  alone fail to motivate these actions. AEEI states that energy  efficiency programs, such as incentives, can help energy  efficiency measures achieve wide enough adoption so that they become sustainable over time in the market without any other support, any behavioral programs can help to increase participation<page number="28" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> in efficiency programs by educating customers  and motivating them to take action. AEEI adds that gas efficiency home audits play an important role in gas safety, as such audits find gas leaks that if undetected could result in significant safety issues. AEEI proposes a five-year transition  framework to be implemented in parallel to existing incentive and resource acquisition  programs to prevent backsliding on energy  efficiency goals, and states that existing programs can be phased out when there is evidence that market-based  programs will perform better. For a successful transition,  AEEI recommends that during the first two years continuous measurement and verification  be established that will allow efficiency to be delivered on a level playing field with other distributed energy  resources and the identification and qualification of market-based  energy  efficiency providers who will deliver savings  outside of existing programs begin. During years two and three AEEI recommends making the true cost of energy  transparent to customers  and educating and incenting customers  to change their behavior. AEEI proposes that during year four, the market infrastructure continue to be developed and<page number="29" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> a study of market-based  energy  efficiency programs comparing their performance with existing programs and a projecting their likelihood of performance be conducted. And during year five, AEEI suggests that goals be established for utilities, a profit mechanism to incent utilities to meet those goals be established, and implementation of the transition  begin.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Association of Energy  Affordability</emphasis></p><p>The Association of Energy  Affordability (AEA) supports adopting gas efficiency programs but recommends that the existing programs continue until the markets are capable of delivering the expected benefits, and states that the role rebates and incentives programs play in driving market transformation  should be considered. In addition, AEA believes that more Commission guidance and direction should be provided for at least the second and third years of the transition,   targets  should be a floor and not a ceiling, and utilities should pursue all efficiency when it is the least cost resource. AEA supports the inclusion of demand reduction in efficiency efforts and program design, as well as the encouragement of innovation, and states the Commission should consider facilitating demonstration<page number="30" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> projects for gas efficiency.</p><p>In regard to the provision of energy  efficiency to low-income  households, AEA states that utilities play an important role in providing this service and it supports program development and coordination for such services without the competition between NYSERDA and the utilities that it states has been a hurdle in past EEPS efforts. In addition, AEA urges the Commission to adopt a policy whereby utilities have specific programs and clear energy   savings   targets  for multifamily buildings, particularly those including explicit requirements for participation and funding  for buildings that house low and moderate income customers. </p><p>Although AEA understands the Commission's intent to move the costs of efficiency programs into a utilities' business costs, it notes that the Commission has not clarified how it intends to reconcile its proposal for a self-direct  program with moving away from identifiable surcharges  for program support.</p><p>AEA states there is merit to transitioning the responsibility of program implementation and verification  tools to the utilities, but states that the process for their development and adoption must include stakeholder  participation and<page number="31" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> Commission review and approval, specifically calling out the development of BCA tools as an area that can be quite controversial and should be determined in a public forum. In addition, AEA states that while uniformity in these tools may be desirable, specific utility system circumstances should be considered.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Corning Natural Gas  Corporation</emphasis></p><p>Corning Natural Gas  Corporation (Corning) states that as it was not included in the proposal to implement gas energy  efficiency programs beginning in 2016, its customers  will not be eligible for rebates after December 31, 2015. Corning states, however, that it has a significant amount of unexpended funds collected through its gas System Benefit Charge (SBC), and it is important that these funds be returned to customers.  To that end, Corning proposed that these funds be used to provide incentives to customers  to convert to natural gas  heat or in the alternative be returned to customers  in the same manner they were collected, as a unit charge, based on volume over a period deemed appropriate by the Commission.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation</emphasis></p><p>National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (NFG) supports the continuation of utility<page number="32" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/>  natural gas   energy  efficiency programs beyond 2015, and comments that ratepayer supported incentives should continue. NFG states that as the cost differences between standard efficiency and high efficiency equipment offerings still exist as a major barrier, and were exacerbated by the elimination of federal tax credits as of December 31, 2011, the removal or lowering of other market barriers through market transformation  strategies may not be enough. NFG agrees that utility and NYSERDA efficiency programs and activities should be complementary, and not redundant, stating that it has successfully coordinated with NYSERDA for over seven years, and such coordination has achieved greater penetration of technologies, while minimizing duplicative efforts and customer  confusion. NFG urges the Commission to confirm that coordinated efforts with NYSERDA should continue, particularly in the low-income  sector.</p><p>NFG supports the development and filing of ETIPs, and further agrees that the E&lt;2&gt; Working Group is the proper venue for the development of ETIPs. NFG objects, however, to the proposal to maintain 2015 efficiency budgets  and targets  for 2016, stating that such an approach limits the ability<page number="33" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> of utilities to improve existing programs, respond to market conditions and customer  demands, and consider the use of recently completed evaluation work. NFG suggests that utilities be given the opportunity to propose budgets  and targets  for 2016 as part of their ETIP filings, stating that this approach would neither delay ETIP submittals nor cause market disruption and backsliding.</p><p>NFG questions how a natural gas   energy  efficiency program, and the actions of a natural gas  only utility would need to become aligned with demand reduction, a phenomenon which only supports the electric  industry, and further states that applying regulatory concepts and policy changes arising out of the REV Proceeding could be counterproductive and costly to natural gas   customers. </p><p>NFG does not support the requirement for natural gas  efficiency portfolios  to include a Self-Direct  program for large commercial and industrial   customers  and notes it was recently communicated that research experts with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) are not aware of the provision of natural gas   self-direct  programs. NFG suggests a more effective approach would be to allow utilities to design programs<page number="34" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> or offerings that would best meet the needs of large commercial and industrial   customers  informed by direct communications with those customers. </p><p>NFG recommends that the Commission refrain from directing natural gas  utilities to assume responsibility for the New York TRM, stating that this task, traditionally performed by Staff, would be administratively burdensome and an inefficient use of utility personnel, particularly for a small utility. NFG adds that no evidence has been provided to support the rationale that Staff or Commission oversight of the TRM is no longer necessary and further comments that no funding  source has been identified to support the transition  of this role to utilities.</p><p>NFG does not support transitioning the cost recovery of energy  efficiency expenses from a surcharge  mechanism to base rates, stating that surcharge  mechanisms are transparent, flexible, and allow for modifications  to program and funding  levels to occur quickly. NFG adds that only energy  efficiency costs associated with utility personnel that work directly on energy  efficiency programs should be recovered through base rates.</p><p>NFG comments that a shareholder incentive structure similar to that in<page number="35" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 263"/> EEPS 2 be developed for 2016, with incentives to be awarded on a positive results basis only, and be tied to utility-developed, and Commission approved metrics.  NFG adds that a funding  source for incentives should be identified, and both the basis for awarding incentives and the magnitude of incentives by utility should be identified, and made clear and simple to understand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Joint Utilities</emphasis></p><p>The Joint Utilities (JU) <footnote><anchor id="fnote6_79_1852_57"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p> Central Hudson Gas and Electric  Corporation, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., KeySpan Gas East Corporation d/b/a National Grid, New York State Electric  &amp; Gas Corporation, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation d/b/a National Grid, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., Rochester Gas and Electric  Corporation, and The Brooklyn Union Gas Company d/b/a National Grid NY submitted joint comments.</p></bodyText></footnote> support the direction of the modifications  proposed for utility-administered gas energy  efficiency programs for implementation beginning in 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf"><emphasis typeStyle="un">2016 Authorized Budgets  and Targets </emphasis></emphasis><table pgwide="376"><tgroup cols="3"><colspec align="left" colname="1" colnum="1" colwidth="128"/><colspec align="left" colname="2" colnum="2" colwidth="112"/><colspec align="left" colname="3" colnum="3" colwidth="136"/><thead><row><entry align="center">Utility</entry><entry align="center">2016 Budget</entry><entry align="center">2016 Dth Target</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>Central Hudson</entry><entry align="right">$ 837,356</entry><entry align="right">37,296</entry></row><row><entry>Con Edison</entry><entry align="right">$ 14,533,466</entry><entry align="right">273,116</entry></row><row><entry>KEDLI</entry><entry align="right">$ 7,164,182</entry><entry align="right">150,139</entry></row><row><entry>KEDNY</entry><entry align="right">$ 12,771,114</entry><entry align="right">254,466</entry></row><row><entry>NFG</entry><entry align="right">$ 10,040,000</entry><entry align="right">345,339</entry></row><row><entry>Niagara Mohawk</entry><entry align="right">10,549,262</entry><entry align="right">450,402</entry></row><row><entry>NYSEG</entry><entry align="right">$ 2,038,215</entry><entry align="right">85,037</entry></row><row><entry>O&amp;R</entry><entry align="right">$ 536,946</entry><entry align="right">14,691</entry></row><row><entry>RG&amp;E</entry><entry align="right">$ 2,720,749</entry><entry align="right">127,121</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><page number="36" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The Tax Refund  Order relates to the intrastate  portion of a refund  that Verizon New York Inc. (Verizon or the Company) received from the City of New York (City), for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 tax years, amounting to $ 13.5 million of the total $ 22.1 million tax refund  that Verizon received from the City.</p><p>On February 6, 2015, Verizon filed a Petition for Partial Rehearing or Reconsideration,  requesting partial rehearing or reconsideration  of the Tax Refund  Order (Petition for Rehearing). As described more fully below, Verizon has failed to raise an adequate basis for rehearing or reconsideration  of the Tax Refund  Order and the petition will be denied in its entirety.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">BACKGROUND</emphasis></h><p>In June 2014, Verizon filed a Petition notifying the Commission, pursuant to <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="16 NY ADMIN 89.3"><content><span normalizedCite="16 N.Y.

In these negotiations, the City offered to lower the Company's assessments. Verizon accepted the City's settlement offer, based upon three factors. First, Verizon would receive an immediate reduction in its 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 property tax assessments; second, costs associated with further litigation would be avoided; and third, that Verizon could expect the City to make more reasonable outside plant  assessments in the future.</p><p>In the Tax Refund  Order, the Commission noted that Verizon currently operates under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and cost-based rate-of-return regulation  is no longer applicable to the Company. Public Service Law  (PSL) Section 113(2), addressing disposition of refunds  such as this tax refund,  is based on the premise that a company's rates are set by the<page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 264"/> Commission through a cost of service ratemaking model and that therefore any refund  received by the Company should be returned to ratepayers. </p><p><citation type="statute" normalizedCite="NY PUB SER 113"><content><span normalizedCite="N.Y.

In its Petition for Rehearing, Verizon argues that the enabling statute, <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="NY PUB SER 113"><content><span normalizedCite="N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law 113">PSL § 113<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#9786#45#000000113 #"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>, provides no basis for directing how a regulated  company should use a tax refund  that the Commission has permitted the company, pursuant to that statute, to retain. Verizon argues that the Commission's power under <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="NY PUB SER 113"><content><span normalizedCite="N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law 113">PSL § 113<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#9786#45#000000113 #"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> is limited to deciding whether a regulated  company may retain all, none, or some portion of a tax refund,  and, if the latter, how much may be retained. Consequently, Verizon maintains, the reservation  of the<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 264"/> right to impose conditions on the retention of future tax refunds  and the imposition of a reporting  obligation on Verizon regarding the intrastate   tax refund  from the City are beyond the Commission's statutory powers under <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="NY PUB SER 113"><content><span normalizedCite="N.Y.

Instead, Verizon maintains, in tax refund  cases, unlike real estate sales, all that has transpired is that Verizon has been "made whole" by the courts and/or taxing authorities, after having been compelled to pay improperly assessed taxes. Verizon concludes that the provisions of the Tax Refund  Order requiring the Report must be rescinded.</p><p>On February 18, 2015, the Secretary issued a Notice Concerning Petition for Rehearing that confirmed tolling of the CPLR Article 78 statute of limitations and sought comments on Verizon's petition. Consistent with the rulemaking provision of the State Administrative Procedures Act (SAPA), a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published<page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Although it would be unworkable for the statute to specify in detail all the ways the Commission might condition its determination of the disposition of a refund,  it is within both the letter and the spirit of § 113(2) for the Commission to require a utility receiving a refund  to report on how the refunded money is spent in the interest of customer service quality and reliability. </p><p>Lastly, we reject Verizon's argument that, unlike the instance in which it realizes a gain from a real estate sale, Verizon has no incremental capital to invest following a tax refund,  because it has merely been "made whole" by the courts<page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

To the contrary, Verizon has received cash not previously available to support its operational performance. Additionally, similar to a gain on sale of real property, with these tax refunds  Verizon will realize an increase in income while also realizing an increase in cash. Verizon's receipt of a refund  increases funds available for use to ensure the service quality that it is obligated to provide and that this Commission is charged with regulating. In the Tax Refund  Order, the Commission simply required the Company to report how the tax refund  impacted operations including increased spending  in either capital or expense budgets. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">The Commission orders</emphasis>:</p><p>1.

PUC LEXIS 265"/> debt under a seven and ten year amortization with interest rates of approximately 7.25% fixed along with an alternate 4.75% variable rate option or a combination of, subject to analysis of proposed terms at closing. The loan will be secured by all material assets of FITC and a pledge of the stock of FITC by Fishers Island  Utility Company (a 51% owner of FITC).</p><p>FITC plans to use the proceeds from the proposed debt financing  to upgrade  its existing infrastructure  that presently includes equipment and technology being discontinued and/or having limited to no support from the respective manufacturers. The projects include replacing a switch with a new digital (soft) switch, extending its fiber network  by building out Fiber to Node network  architecture, and installing a new microwave tower capable of 1G transmissions. Theses upgrades  to FITC's infrastructure  will support progress in meeting New York State's broadband goals. Currently, FITC's residential   customers  are able to purchase internet access at speeds of 2 Mbps download  and 1 Mbps upload.  Upon full implementation of these upgrades,  FITC's customers  will have the standard options of 25 Mbps download  and 3 Mbps upload  available.<br/><page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The Office of Telecommunication has reviewed the forecasted capital expenditures  and found them to be reasonable. The Sources and Uses of Funds are reflected in Appendix A of this Order.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Reimbursement   Margin </emphasis></p><p>The purpose of a reimbursement  margin  is to ensure that the amount of long-term  securities outstanding does not exceed the issuer's investments in utility plant, property and equipment. In its petition, FITC calculates  that the historic reimbursement  margin  as of December 31, 2014 was $ 738,545. Staff has used a pro forma balance sheet reimbursement  margin  to calculate  the companies' projected reimbursement  margin  of approximately $ 1,630,876 through December 31, 2015.

The Company's gas revenue requirement then increased by $ 5.854 million, or 4.9 percent, in RY 2 (April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015) and increased by an additional $ 6.268 million, or 4.9 percent, in RY 3.</p><p>Pursuant to the 2013 Rate Order, Niagara Mohawk was directed to file amendments effectuating the provisions of RY 3 on not less than 30 days' notice to be effective  on a temporary  basis on April 1, 2015.

(Con Edison or the Company). Pursuant to the rate plan extension, the net impact of electric  revenue requirement increases and the use of customer  credits is a freeze of electric  base delivery  rates for this additional year. The rate plan extension also includes, among other things, a collaborative  framework for addressing the Company's Advanced Metering  Infrastructure (AMI) initiative, and modifications  to the Company's Standby  Service, including, establishing a performance-based credit mechanism to provide Standby customers  the opportunity to earn a credit against their contract demand charges based on the performance of their generating  facilities.</p><p><page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

By Untitled Order issued February 23, 2015 in Case 15-E-0050 (2105 Filing), the Commission suspended the effective  date of the major rate change through June 28, 2015 and instituted a proceeding to investigate the Company' rate filing.</p><p>Based on Con Edison's projections of capital investment and operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) expense, and the level of available customer  credits, the Company, Staff  of the Department of Public Service (Staff)  and several interested parties  held an exploratory technical discussion on February 19, 2015 to discuss whether there was an opportunity to extend the current Electric  Rate Plan in lieu of the 2015 Filing. Presently, the Electric  Rate Plan encompasses two <page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> rate years, January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 (RY1) and January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 (RY2). The Joint Proposal would extend the Electric  Rate Plan to a third rate year (from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (RY3)). The Joint Proposal is attached as Appendix A.</p><p>On February 23, 2015, the Company filed a Notice  of Impending Settlement Negotiations pursuant to <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="16 NY ADMIN 3.9"><content><span normalizedCite="16 N.Y.

Thereafter, interested parties  met on February 27th and in March and April to discuss the extension of the Electric  Rate Plan. This resulted in the Joint Proposal before the Commission. The following parties executed the Joint Proposal: Con Edison; Staff;  New York Power Authority (NYPA); City of New York (City); the Utility Intervention Unit, Division of Consumer Protection, New York State Department of State (UIU), Consumer Power Advocates (CPA); New York Energy Consumers Council, Inc. (NYECC); Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA); Pace Energy and Climate Center (Pace); Environmental Defense Fund (EDF); NRG Energy (NRG); General Services Administration (GSA); Northeast Clean Heat and Power Initiative (NECHPI); <page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> ECubed Company LLC and the Joint Supporters (Joint Supporters/Ecubed); and, Bernhard Energy (Bernhard).</p><p>On May 15, 2015, Con Edison held a meeting with several Standby   customers  to discuss the performance credit as proposed in the Joint Proposal. This program is discussed in full below. It was determined that it was technically infeasible for customers  to purchase and install revenue grade meters  and associated telecommunications equipment compatible with the Con Edison system for the first test period beginning June 15, 2015, as contemplated by the Joint Proposal. As a result, an alternative measure was discussed and agreed upon by the parties, which would allow a different means of measuring generator output  to verify performance during the test period. These changes to the Standby  rate proposal are included in the addendum to the Joint Proposal, which was filed on June 2, 2015, and is attached as Appendix B.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">THE JOINT PROPOSAL</emphasis></h><p>The Joint Proposal contains the terms and conditions for RY3 by modifying specific provisions of the Electric  Rate Plan, reflected by instruction and/or text under the applicable section of Appendix C of the 2014 Rate Order. Other provisions that are <page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> not changed are indicated with a heading, but no instructions and/or text. Unless otherwise noted, any provisions of the Appendix C of the 2014 Rate Order that reference RY1 and RY2 for electric  shall be read to also apply to RY3, consistent with paragraph L.1 of Appendix C, which provides that its provisions will continue after RY2 for electric  unless and until electric  base delivery  rates are changed by Commission order. Similarly, for any credits due to electric  customers  or Con Edison's recovery of costs from electric  customers  that are being amortized over a three or more year period, the Joint Proposal indicates that the revenue requirement for RY3 reflects the annual amount of such credits due electric  customers  or costs due the Company.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Incremental Revenue Requirement for RY3</emphasis></p><p>The Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission increase the Company's revenue requirement by $ 74.857 million for RY3. An incremental revenue requirement increase of $ 74.857 million would address projected  increases in expenditures  over RY2, including a small increase to O&amp;M, carrying charges on projected  capital expenditures,  which include continuing storm  hardening and resiliency programs, <page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> and the initial capital expenditures  related to AMI.</p><p>To achieve the freeze of base electric delivery  rates proposed under the Joint Proposal, the Company would recognize in other operating revenues $ 92.6 million of customer  credits that have accrued to customers,  <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_22_305_41"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> According to Staff,  $ 153 million of customer  credits are projected  to remain on the books of the Company, and should be available to ameliorate future need by the Company for revenue requirement relief. A list of the credits and debits to be applied during RY3 is in Appendix 4 of the Joint Proposal.</p></bodyText></footnote> plus an additional $ 30.1 million of customer  credits that have accrued resulting from the amounts of annual revenue requirement changes for RY1 and RY2 in accordance with the Electric  Rate Plan, with interest. <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_22_311_113"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> An explanation of derivation of the $ 30.1 million credit may be found in the 2014 Rate Order at 44-46.</p></bodyText></footnote> $ 47.776 million of the credits would be applied in 2016 as a bill credit to fully offset  the delivery  revenue requirement increase approved for RY2, thus, the base delivery  rate freeze would continue for RY3. Because the Joint Proposal would not make any changes to revenue allocation or rate design, base electric delivery  rates for RY3 would be frozen at the same level as RY2.</p><p><page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/></p><p>According to the Joint Proposal, because the delivery  revenue change (which uses accrued customer  credits) will not cause any electric  base delivery  rate changes, no interclass revenue adjustments were made for RY3. In addition, the Joint Proposal provides that the Company's next rate filing will be premised upon an Embedded Cost of Service (ECOS) study using calendar year data that is no more than two years prior to the calendar year in which the filing is made. However, this requirement would not apply to any rate filing made in 2016. The Joint Proposal also would continue the requirement in the 2014 Rate Order that the Company continue discussions with the parties with regard to whether any additional, more current data, will further inform the next ECOS study and/or the proposed revenue allocation. The other requirements regarding the Company's future ECOS study in Appendix C of the 2014 Rate Order would be applicable to Con Edison's next electric  rate filing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Return on Equity and Sharing </emphasis><page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/><emphasis typeStyle="un"> of Overearnings</emphasis></p><p>The current Electric  Rate Plan provides the Company with the opportunity to earn an allowed ROE of 9.2%. The Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission adopt an ROE of 9.0% for RY3. In addition, it provides that the earnings   sharing  thresholds would be adjusted to reflect the lower allowed ROE, but would otherwise be unchanged from those adopted in the 2014 Electric  Rate Order.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Cost of Debt</emphasis></p><p>The Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission determine a weighted average cost of long-term debt of 5.09% for electric  in RY3, rather than the 5.17% (RY1) or 5.23% (RY2) allowed under the 2014 Rate Order. Included in this weighted average cost rate is 2.28% for electric  Variable Rate Debt (<emphasis typeStyle="un">i.e</emphasis>., the Company's entire tax-exempt debt portfolio). Under the proposal, Con Edison would be allowed to true-up its actual weighted average cost of Variable Rate Debt during RY3 to the costs rates for Variable Rate Debt set forth in Appendix 8 of the Joint Proposal. Should the Variable Rate Debt be refinanced by the Company with tax-exempt or taxable debt (which may include retiring the Variable Rate Debt) prior to January 1, 2017 for electric  (including under circumstances<page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The final cost of $ 78.3 million is equal to the amount reflected in rates ($ 26.1 million for each of RY1, RY2, and RY3). Since Staff  has completed its audit of the storm  costs, the Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission determine that the Non-Superstorm<page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> Sandy Deferred  Major Storm  Costs no longer be subject to Staff  review and, therefore, no longer be subject to refund.</p><p>Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Costs total $ 251.6 million as of December 31, 2014. The Joint Proposal recommends  that these deferred  costs be reduced by $ 4.375 million, to $ 247.225 million. This amount is $ 3.025 million more than the $ 244.2 million reflected in rates for RY1, RY2 and RY3. Under the Joint Proposal, this $ 3.025 million balance would remain as a charge against the Major Storm  Reserve and would be addressed in the next electric  base rate proceeding for the Company. As with the Non-Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Major Storm  Costs, the Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission determine that the Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Costs no longer be subject to Staff  review and no longer subject to refund.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Other Proposals to Implement RY3</emphasis></p><p>A number of other recommendations are made under the Joint Proposal to allow for the continuation of the requirements of the 2104 Rate Order.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Storm  Hardening and Resiliency Collaborative </emphasis></p><p>To reflect the fact that the Commission directed that the Storm  Hardening and Resiliency Collaborative  address electric  matters in Phase<page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Of particular note, the Joint Proposal provides that, upon adoption of the Joint Proposal, Con Edison would file supplements with the Secretary to the Commission canceling the tariff  leaves filed in Case 15-E-0050. This would close Case 15-E-0050 and prevent the tariffs  filed under that case from going into effect.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Low Income  Reconnection Fee Waiver</emphasis></p><p>Among the tariff  changes proposed, the Joint Proposal requires the Company to file an amendment to General Rule 15.2 to extend the effectiveness of the reconnection<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> fee waiver for low income  customers.  Reconnection fee waivers would be capped at $ 500,000 for RY3.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">AMI Collaborative </emphasis></p><p>The Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission reflect capital expenditures  in the Company's revenue requirement for several initiatives associated with the Company's implementation of AMI in its electric  and gas systems.</p><p>In the collaborative  process, the Company is to consider the feasibility of providing access to near real-time data to customers  and third parties authorized to have access to customer  data, including authorized energy services companies (ESCOs) in the design and formation of its AMI business plan.  The Joint Proposal also requires that Con Edison consider experiences by utilities in other states and Canada in the design and formation of its AMI business plan.  This is intended to identify the benefits, best practices, and impediments experienced and identified by these utilities, for Con Edison to take into account in the design and formation of its AMI business plan. </p><p>The Company's AMI business plan  is to be comprised of seven primary components, according to the Joint Proposal. For the following components specific costs and a schedule for<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> implementation in 2016 would be provided: a Meter  Asset Management System (MAMS); a Meter  Data Management System (MDMS); and, system software integration. The remaining four primary components are: Meters  and Communication Systems (including equipment costs); Meters  and Communication System Installation (which would include a "high" level estimate of costs and a preliminary schedule); an updated and detailed Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) (which would consider, among other things, net remaining plant  associated with existing meters  and related components to be replaced with AMI meters  and a sensitivity analysis to examine the impacts on cost-effectiveness of a range of potential meter  and/or communication cost overruns); and, a Consumer Engagement plan, with privacy principles and rules for third-party access to data consistent with the REV proceeding and other proceedings and rules involving access to meters. </p><p>The signatory parties propose that the AMI collaborative  meet certain deadlines in order to develop the AMI business plan  for the Company, with the final business plan  subject to Commission review and approval. The AMI collaborative  process provides for specific considerations <page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> to be taken into account, various meeting dates, and party input on iterations of the plan prior to the Company filing the plan with the Commission.</p><p>The revenue requirement in the Joint Proposal includes the Company's preliminary estimates of capital costs for several initiatives related to AMI. The revenues included in the proposed revenue requirement are subject to reconciliation  in the event that the Commission approves a lower budget when it reviews the Company's AMI business plan  filing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Standby  Service</emphasis></p><p>The Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission adopt three changes to the current Standby   tariff.  Under the first proposal, the three MAC charge components would be replaced with a single per-kWh MAC charge applicable to Standby   customers,  similar to the per-kWh MAC charge applicable to all other customers  taking service under P.S.C. No. 10.</p><p>The second change would apply to Offset   customers,  defined as those customers  taking service under General Rule 20.2.1(b)(7) or General Rule 20.2.1(b)(8). Presently, these customers  are assessed certain charges on a per-kWh basis based on the customer's  total kWh usage, including kWh produced by the customer's   generating  facility. <page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> The Joint Proposal recommends  that the assessment of per-kWh charges for such customers  be based on the customer's  total usage net of kWh produced by the customer's   generating  facility.</p><p>Finally, the Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission allow the Company to provide Standby   customers  of Con Edison and NYPA the opportunity to earn performance-based credits against their contract demand charges based on the performance of their generating  facilities connected at a voltage lower than 100 kV, thus advancing the Commission's REV agenda. The contract demand credit would allow customers  the opportunity to earn credit for reliable performance of their generator(s). The credit would offset  the customer's  contract demand charges, based on the minimum generation output  during the period from June 15, 2015 to September 15, 2015, 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. each day.</p><p>The Joint Proposal originally provided that in order to take advantage of this opportunity, customers'   generating  facilities must be separately metered using Commission-approved, revenue grade, interval metering  with telecommunications capability with Con Edison's system. However, subsequently the parties determined that there <page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> was not enough time for customers  to purchase and install the required metering  equipment and telecommunications with Con Edison's system for the 2015 summer season. Therefore, there is a modification  to the Joint Proposal (Appendix B). Under the modification,  for 2015, the requirements allow the alternative process of using a Meter  Data Service Provider to verify performance during the 2015 test period, only. For 2016, the original requirement that customers'   generating  facilities must be separately metered using Commission-approved, revenue grade, interval metering  with telecommunications capability would be in effect. All signatory parties who filed comments addressing the issue have indicated that they agree with and support the modification. </p><p>For 2016, the customer  would still be responsible for the costs and installation of Commission-approved, revenue grade, interval metering  with telecommunications capability. Communication service for meter (s) measuring the generator's output  must also be provided by the customer  at its expense. As required by the Joint Proposal, on May 15, 2015 the Company notified all existing Standby customers  of the potential availability of the performance<page number="17" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

In instances where the customer  participates in the program for the first year, the measurement  period will be from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM during the previous full summer period, which is defined as June 15th through September 15th, and adjusted for outage events. <footnote><anchor id="fnote7_56_869_171"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p> For this mechanism, the measurement  period will exclude up to three outage events each summer, regardless of cause, comprised of no more than five 24-hour weekday periods, where (i) each outage event may be comprised of one or more consecutive 24-hour periods, and (ii) any part of a 24-hour period (excluding weekends and holidays) will count as one of the five 24-hour periods.

Credits provided to Con Edison customers  under this program would be collected through the MAC, while credits provided to NYPA Standby   customers  would be recovered from NYPA through a separately identified Standby  surcharge applicable only to NYPA. Under the proposed mechanism, Con Edison would be required to file an annual report with the Secretary to the Commission detailing the number of customers  that received the credit, the number of customers  that applied for the credit but did not qualify, aggregated reasons why the customers  did not qualify, and the total cost of the credits. <page number="19" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The majority of the comments were from residential customers,  almost all of whom opposed the Company's proposed rate increase. The general theme of these comments in opposition to a rate increase was that the Company already collects enough money from its customers;  some of whom are on a fixed income or have not seen their wages increase. Citing personal economic hardships, some felt that Con Edison should be the one to "tighten its belt" instead of them. Customers  complained that Con Edison should decrease the dividend to its shareholders instead of seeking more money from customers,  noting that dividends have been increasing over the last 10 years. One customer  pointed to perceived failures in responding to Superstorm Sandy as a reason to reject the request. Other customers  believed that website design and taxes should not be recovered from customers. </p><p>Comments were also received from residential customers  complaining about the deployment of "smart" meters;  claiming detrimental health effects from Electromagnetic<page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> fields (EMF) and expressing privacy concerns regarding the use of data derived from these meters.  Most of these commentators asked the Commission to prevent their use by not funding them and to require the Company to allow the use of the old analog meters  at their residences.</p><p>On March 6, 2015, Bernhard and Related Companies filed comments expressing their appreciation of a Standby  rate proposal presented by Staff  in the REV proceeding <footnote><anchor id="fnote9_67_1031_104"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-M-0101, <emphasis typeStyle="un">Proceeding on Motion of the Commission in Regard to Reforming the Energy Vision</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></footnote>, but suggest their own proposals, including establishing a rate structure for customers  that have paid for the installation of high tension and low tension electric  distribution infrastructure, but are billed under the low tension tariff  and that for Offset customers,  that their contract demand charges be based on generator output,  not building load.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Comments in Response to Notices </emphasis></p><p>Comments filed in response to the SAPA Notice  and the Commission's Notice  Soliciting Comments <page number="22" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> were received from the signatory parties, which are addressed below. Comments were also received from a non-signatory party, Local 1-2 (the Union). The Union requests that the Commission condition any approval of the Joint Proposal on the Company "committing" to two obligations, as discussed below. On June 11, 2015, Grassroots Environmental Education filed regarding its concerns about "smart" meters.  These comments are also addressed below.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Staff </emphasis></p><p>Staff  comments address a number of issues related to the Joint Proposal including incremental revenue requirement needs, ROE, cost of debt, the sharing  mechanism for overearnings, correcting a Federal income tax error, deferred   storm  costs, reconciliations,   low income  reconnection fee waiver, AMI collaborative,  and changes to Standby  Service. Staff   recommends  that the Commission find the terms of the Joint Proposal meet the requirements of the Settlement Guidelines and, therefore, that the Commission adopt the Joint Proposal in its entirety.</p><p>According to Staff,  Con Edison's capital expenditure  plan is driven by system expansion addressing load growth and the needed Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) capital work to ensure the provision<page number="23" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> of safe and adequate service and reliability relating to the storm  hardening and resiliency work the Company is undertaking to mitigate the impact of strong storms,  like Superstorm Sandy, and to ensure that the system is resilient enough to ensure continuity of service. The Joint Proposal provides for adjustments of $ 26.137 million to the Company's proposed 2016 capital spending plan as presented in the 2015 Rate Filing. This adjustment equates to a revenue requirement reduction of approximately $ 2.6 million. Staff  indicates that detailed individual project and program descriptions, work papers, pre-filed interrogatory responses, plant-in-service models, were reviewed. In addition, it points out that the record in the fully litigated case, Case 13-E-0030, was reviewed and that it included Con Edison's proposed capital expenditures  through 2017. Regarding O&amp;M, Staff  notes that the Joint Proposal would provide Con Edison with an additional $ 9 million increase over the RY2 level, or 0.7%, substantially lower than inflation. Staff,  however, states its belief that this level is sufficient to allow the continuation of safe and adequate service.</p><p>Regarding the cost of long-term debt, Staff <page number="24" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> states that this cost is projected  to decrease due to decreases in the embedded cost of unsecured debt. Staff  indicates that a long-term debt cost rate of 5.09% for RY3 (compared to the 5.23% reflected for RY2) is appropriate. Because short-term interest rates remain highly unpredictable, difficult to forecast, and because the cost rates associated with Con Edison's variable rate debt is almost entirely out of its control, as allowed in the 2014 Rate Order, the cost rate of the will protect customers  if the increase in short-term debt projected  in the Joint Proposal is less than anticipated.</p><p>The ROE would be reset under the Joint Proposal and Staff  states that an allowed ROE of 9.0% (compared to an allowed 9.2% in the 2014 Rate Order) reflects the Commission's methodology in determining the cost of equity, with allowances that reflect Con Edison's acceptance of some terms that potentially increase its exposure to earnings  variation. Staff  notes that, since the 2014 Rate Order, capital costs have declined and also that the proposed ROE is the same as authorized by the Commission in a recent order for KeySpan Gas East Corporation d/b/a National Grid. The 48.0% common equity ratio reflected<page number="25" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> in the Joint Proposal is the same as common equity ratio in the Electric  Rate Plan.</p><p>Staff  explains in detail how the earnings   sharing  mechanism under the Electric  Rate Plan would be modified to reflect the lower proposed ROE of 9.0%. The electric   earnings   sharing  threshold would be set at 60 basis points above the recommended ROE of 9.0% in the rate year, or 9.6%. Earnings  above the thresholds up to and including 10.25% would be shared equally (50%/50%) between customers  and the Company. Earnings  above 10.25% and up to and including 10.75% would be shared 75%/25% between customers  and the Company, respectively. Earnings  in excess of 10.75% would be shared 90%/10% between customers  and the Company, respectively. Staff  also notes that the earnings   sharing  mechanism would continue after RY3, thus ensuring potential sharing  of overearnings after the expiration of the rate plan extension.</p><p>Staff  explains in its comments that a material error in the calculation of Federal income tax (FIT) expense was found in the Electric  Rate Plan. According to Staff,  a tax benefit related to removal costs was flowed to customers  twice. In the first instance, the projected  removal costs were reflected as<page number="26" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> a reduction to FIT expense. Second, Con Edison made an error in its computation of flow through tax depreciation by adding tax depreciation for removal costs as an offset  to book depreciation expense. Thus, removal costs were double counted in determining FIT expense for ratemaking purposes. Correction of this error requires a $ 93 million increase to the RY3 revenue requirement. Staff  supports correction of the error on a prospective basis.</p><p>In its comments, Staff  indicates that it has completed its audit of both Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Major Storm  Costs and Non-Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Major Storm  Costs and recommends  the Commission adopt the results of its audits. According to Staff,  Con Edison claimed Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Major Storm  Costs totaling $ 251.6 million as of December 31, 2014. Based on Staff's  review, the Joint Proposal recommends  that the costs be reduced by $ 4.375 million, to $ 247.255 million. This amount is $ 3.025 million more than the $ 244.2 million reflected in the Joint Proposal. Staff  indicates that as a result, $ 3.025 million would remain as a charge against the Major Storm  Reserve and would be addressed in the Company's next rate filing.</p><p>Staff   <page number="27" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> indicates that for Non-Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Major Storm  Costs, the Commission should determine that the final amount as of December 31, 2014 is $ 78.3 million. Since the $ 78.3 million was amortized over three years in the 2014 Rate Order, the Joint Proposal would reflect in RY3 the remaining amortized amount, or one-third of $ 78.3 million.</p><p>Staff   recommends  that Non-Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Major Storm  Costs no longer be subject to refund.</p><p>Regarding the reconciliations  in the Joint Proposal, Staff  states that the reconciliations  established in the 2014 Rate Order would continue in RY3, but would be updated for net plant  and the variable rate component of long term debt cost. Staff  states that the mechanisms are appropriate as they are designed to protect both customers  and the Company against variations in estimated costs as well as to maintain stability and consistency in both earnings  and rates.</p><p>Staff's  comments also address the continuation in the Joint Proposal of the low income  reconnection fee waiver. According to Staff,  waiver would be continued at the same RY2 funding level of $ 500,000. To accomplish this, Con Edison would file an amendment to its tariff,  General Rule<page number="28" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> 15.2. Staff  notes that this program should be continued because it allows low income   customers  who have fallen behind in paying their electric  bills to be reconnected to the Company's system without paying the reconnection fee.</p><p>According to Staff,  the AMI collaborative  process proposed in the Joint Proposal should be adopted because it would provide parties the opportunity to fully review Con Edison's AMI business plan,  affording the parties input into the Company's plans and the technology it would deploy. The AMI business plan  would then be presented to the Commission for its review and action. Staff  further states the Joint Proposal does not contemplate the actual deployment of AMI meters  to measure service, and the $ 3.4 million included in the revenue requirement would be used by the Company to perform preliminary work on development of its AMI business plan.   Staff  also notes this funding is subject to "claw-back" should the Commission later determine, based on its review of the AMI business plan,  that the funding should not have been provided, in whole or in part.</p><p>In its comments, Staff  explains that the Joint Proposal recommends  three changes related to Standby  Service. The<page number="29" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> first would result in the Monthly Adjustment Clause (MAC) costs being collected on a per kilowatt hour (kWh) basis rather than by the current Standby  rate elements, which are a customer  charge, a contract demand charge, and a daily as-used demand charge. Staff  indicates that this change is appropriate as it would make recovery of MAC costs from Standby   customers  consistent with MAC cost recovery from non-Standby customers  and would simplify calculation of the MAC, thus allowing customers  to check and verify these charges on their bills.</p><p>The second change would apply only to Offset   customers  and provides that the kWh surcharges applicable to them would be based on kWh consumption net of generation. Staff  indicates that the purpose of this change is to treat Offset   customers  the same as other Standby   customers. </p><p>Staff  states that the third change proposed to Standby  Service would establish a performance-based credit to Offset   customers'  contract demand charges that could be earned by Standby   customers  based on the performance of their generation during a set time period. Staff  further notes that this is not a comprehensive solution for valuing the contributions of distributed generation, <page number="30" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> but an interim measure which will capture data to allow for more robust design process in future proceedings before the Commission. It will allow generators to show that they can perform as reliable distribution level system assets and help advance the Commission's REV policies. Finally, Staff  also supports the modification  to this program for 2015, as described in the addendum to the Joint Proposal, because due to technical issues the metering  and communication equipment originally required could not be installed by June 15, 2015 for the first test period. The modification  in the addendum will ensure that those who wish to participate in the program will be able to do so.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Con Edison</emphasis></p><p>According to the Company, it supports the Joint Proposal because, if adopted by the Commission, it would provide the Company with the funds needed to build, operate and maintain safe and adequate electric  systems, including funds for storm  hardening and resiliency projects, provides for sufficient returns to allow it to raise capital at reasonable terms and to maintain its financial integrity. In addition, Con Edison states that the Joint Proposal mitigates rate increases, continues to impose on it<page number="31" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> the responsibility to perform efficiently, maintains the low income  program and performance metrics, establishes a collaborative  framework for its AMI initiative, and modifies Standby  Service to, among other things, provide Standby   customers  the opportunity to earn a credit against their contract demand charges based on the performance of their generating  facilities. Con Edison notes that the Joint Proposal comports with the Commission's Settlement Guidelines and the outcome proposed falls within the reasonably expected range of potential litigated outcomes of the 2015 Filing.</p><p>Con Edison states that customers  would benefit from the adoption of the Joint Proposal because it would avoid an increase in delivery  rates while providing the Company with additional revenues, albeit significantly less than those requested in the 2015 Filing. Regarding Return on Equity (ROE), the Company comments that it was very difficult for the Company to accept, but it did so in the context of the other provisions of the Joint Proposal and in recognition of the Commission's policy regarding ROEs for both one-year and multi-year rate plans. Absent the entire negotiated framework, the ROE of 9.0% would not<page number="32" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> be acceptable to the Company.</p><p>The Company notes that the Joint Proposal reflects $ 68 million of projected  capital expenditures  for its AMI program during 2016. These expenditures  are primarily for its implementation of a MAMS and a MDMS. According to the Company, there are certain limitations with its existing meter  asset management system (ADAMS) as it was built on obsolete technology from the 1980s. The new MDMS will support additional future interval metering  processing requirements, including connection with anticipated increases in demand response program participation and to support the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) resulting from the Commission's REV initiatives.</p><p>According to Con Edison, AMI is a multi-dimensional platform that will improve customer  functionality in energy management and will advance the goals of REV, as detailed in the testimony in the 2015 Filing. The collaborative  process proposed in the Joint Proposal will facilitate stakeholder input into the development of its AMI business plan,  providing Staff  and the parties with transparency as to the Company's activities and projected  costs.</p><p>The Company also discusses the proposed changes to Standby <page number="33" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> Service, noting that it was willing to make certain changes to Standby  Service rather than defer those changes to the next rate filing or Track two of the REV proceeding. <footnote><anchor id="fnote10_92_1580_163"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-M-0101, supra, Order Adopting Regulatory Policy Framework and Implementation Plan, at 19.</p></bodyText></footnote> These changes, according to Con Edison, are beneficial to Standby customers  and reasonable in the context of cost allocation to its non-Standby customers. </p><p>Con Edison concludes that the Joint Proposal should be adopted in its entirety because it resolves the myriad issues presented in a manner fully consistent with the public interest, falls within the range of results that could be expected in a litigated outcome, reflects agreement among normally adverse parties and comports with the Commission's current policies.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">NYC</emphasis></h><p>NYC notes that it is one of the largest customers  on Con Edison's electric  system and indicates that adoption of the Joint Proposal would result in fair and reasonable rates. NYC states that the Joint Proposal reasonably resolves<page number="34" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> a limited set of issues from the 2015 Rate Filing and continues the terms and conditions of the Electric  Rate Plan for one additional year. It notes that one of the positive outcomes is the fact that there generally will not be any bill impact for NYC customers.  It also notes that the Joint Proposal includes other issues important to NYC.</p><p>One of these important issues is AMI. According to the NYC, AMI offers many benefits to Con Edison customers  and NYC. In particular, AMI would allow the Company to identify with great granularity those customers  experiencing an outage of service rather than having to rely, as it does now, on customers,  its crews and field inspectors and substation-level data to notify it of outages. AMI data will allow the Company to improve and expedite its response efforts; thereby limiting the time people are without electricity, which NYC states is a basic human need. Other benefits include: enhancing Con Edison's coordination with NYC and other governmental officials-particularly the provision of restoration information and the implementation of emergency response plans, and allowing customers  to more actively monitor and control their energy usage. NYC states<page number="35" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> that even though the costs seem high, AMI is the future of metering  technology.</p><p>NYC comments that current Standby  rates are an impediment to the full development of distributed generation in the Company's service territory. According to it, two of the three proposed Standby  Service changes in the Joint Proposal, the modification  of the MAC to charge Standby customers  a single per kWh charge and applying the per kWh surcharges to campus style combined heat and power facilities net of self-generation, are appropriate. The first change would streamline and simplify the billing process and the second proposed change would allow campus-style customers  to be treated in the same manner as other Standby customers.  According to NYC the third proposal, the performance credit to the Standby customer's  contract demand, would provide what it views as much needed rate relief and affords what it calls a bridge to a more comprehensive review of Standby  rates that will be undertaken in the REV proceeding. <footnote><anchor id="fnote11_98_1669_210"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-M-0101, <emphasis typeStyle="un">Proceeding on Motion of the Commission in Regard to Reforming the Energy Vision</emphasis>, Order Adopting Regulatory Policy Framework and Implementation Plan (issued February 26, 2015) at 110.</p></bodyText></footnote> According to NYC, the contract demand credit is an initial step forward as it attempts to monetize the value of distributed generation to the Company's electric  system and provides some relief<page number="36" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

PUC LEXIS 269"/> long term operations and credit ratings. NYC agrees with others that the Joint Proposal allow shareholders to earn a reasonable return on their investment while maintaining just and reasonable rates, thus balancing the interests of shareholders and customers. </p><p>Finally, with regard to rate design, NYC notes that the Joint Proposal reflects the current requirements of the Electric  Rate Plan which provides that if the Company files for a rate increase in 2017 instead of 2016, it will also prepare a new ECOS study using calendar year data that is no more than two years old. NYC notes that the remaining rate design and revenue allocation provisions of the Joint Proposal generally continue and clarify the current requirements in the Electric  Rate Plan.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">CPA</emphasis></h><p>CPA states that the Joint Proposal is in the best interests of its members and is "superior" to its expectations of the potential result of any settlement for Case 15-E-0050, and that it spares the parties from the costly effort involved in a major rate case. CPA points to the improvements in the Standby  Service recommended in the Joint Proposal; which include restructuring of the MAC charge, the use of net energy purchased in place<page number="38" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> of gross energy taken from the Con Edison system and the potential to earn credit on Standby   customers'  contract demand. CPA notes that the Joint Proposal would allow these changes to be effective  for Summer 2015, rather than Summer 2016, which would not have occurred but for the Joint Proposal.</p><p>Regarding AMI, CPA states that the proposed collaborative  process will provide the parties the opportunity to ensure that AMI meets the customers'  needs and avoid potentially costly "missteps" in Con Edison's implementation of AMI.</p><p>Finally, CPA notes that, while the Joint Proposal does not resolve all issues, such as depreciation and revenue allocation, it believes that these issues can be deferred  without undue harm to its members and to customers  in general. Thus, CPA urges the Commission to adopt the Joint Proposal.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">NYPA</emphasis></h><p>NYPA recommends  that the Commission adopt the Joint Proposal without modification  as it supports the continuation of the current delivery  rates (the freeze of base rates), the continuation of the current revenue allocation and the preservation of the rate design mechanism that caps NYPA customers'  exposure to PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. costs. It further states that<page number="39" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> settling these issues through the continuation of RY2 rate provisions for another year is appropriate in the current economic and budgetary climate. According to NYPA, the Joint Proposal, if adopted, would preserve valuable resources of Staff  and other parties, maintain Con Edison's financial integrity, and help relieve electric   customers  from potential economic hardship.</p><p>NYPA also indicates that it supports the Joint Proposal since it would ensure that the Company use its 2013 Embedded Cost of Service (ECOS) study for any delivery  rate filing that is made in 2015 or 2016. According to NYPA, this recognizes the challenges faced by Con Edison in developing a new ECOS study, while requiring it to file a revised ECOS study if it makes an electric  rate filing in 2017 or later. NYPA also supports the Joint Proposal's requirements that the Company reevaluate the cost-of-service methodologies, conduct a post filing "walk-though" with the parties to explain the ECOS study, and provide a detailed explanation in support of the study. NYPA also indicates its support of the recommended revisions to Standby  Service since it sees distributed generation as a growing area in the long term. The performance<page number="40" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> based credit to offset  a standby   customer's  contract demand is viewed as a positive step that will encourage more distributed generation. NYPA notes that NYPA customers  will only pay for the performance based credits provided to NYPA Standby   customers,  while customers  of the Company will pay for the performance based credits provided to its customers  through the MAC. NYPA believes this to be appropriate since more Con Edison customers  likely could participate in this program than NYPA customers. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">NYECC</emphasis></h><p>NYECC states that the Joint Proposal continues "virtually all" of the provisions from the Electric  Rate Plan by an additional year and uses available customer  credits to offset  incremental revenue requirement needs instead of a potential $ 416 million increase proposed under Case 15-E-0050. After explaining a number of changes to the Electric  Rate Plan proposed in the Joint Proposal, NYECC explains that it believes that the Joint Proposal would confer significant benefits compared to litigating the 2015 Filing, thus it should be adopted by the Commission.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Joint Supporters/Ecubed and NECHPI</emphasis></p><p>Joint Supporters/Ecubed and NECHPI's letters in support of the Joint Proposal state that<page number="41" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The Union notes that it raised these issues in Case<page number="42" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> 13-E-0030, and takes note that the Commission instituted Case 13-M-0449 to review the employment practices of investor-owned utilities regarding the use of in house and contractor labor. <footnote><anchor id="fnote13_117_1878_229"/><label>13</label><bodyText><p> Case 13-M-0449, <emphasis typeStyle="un">In the Matter of Focused Operations Audit of the Internal Staffing Levels and the Use of Contractors for Selected Core Utility Functions at Major New York Energy Utilities</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></footnote> It is concerned that in the meantime customers  are put at risk by Con Edison's labor practices and the Joint Proposal does not address labor issues.

The use of contractors for such activities, according to the Union, raises questions in the study, especially in light of the study's assertion that it maintains a cadre of in-house personnel sufficient to handle day-today operations and maintenance of its energy systems. Therefore, the Union states that its proposed condition regarding the "commitment" to use the July 2010 Human Resources Guidance Memo should be adopted by the Commission since a requirement to follow its own process should not be objectionable.</p><p>The Union also seeks a commitment that the Company implement a program to recruit and hire veterans and inner-city youths for its internal work force. It states that this "commitment" on the part of Con Edison would address its concern that a significant number of in-house employees will be reaching retirement age in the next two years. The Union believes that it would be beneficial to it, the Company and customers  if Con Edison employed in-house veterans who have served their country as well as inner-city youths who have "pride in their City and wish to serve it while being gainfully<page number="44" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Citing the February 26, 2015 order in the REV proceeding, Pace believes that the collaborative  process proposed in the Joint Proposal is consistent with the goals of stakeholder engagement.</p><p>Regarding Standby  Service, Pace notes that the various changes to the service will benefit customers.  It notes that the June 2, 2015 modification  addresses the fact that the metering  requirement for the period commencing June 15, 2015 was found to be technically challenging for customers  by providing for an alternative means to verify generator performance.

That 16 parties to these proceedings, representing a wide diversity of interests, have executed the Joint Proposal is a testament to the extensive efforts employed by the parties to address the issues pertaining to the extension of the Electric  Rate Plan and the equitable resolution, comprehensiveness and reasonableness of the Joint Proposal's provisions.</p><p>The Joint Proposal would produce a result within the range that could be expected in litigation, and arguably provide a better result than litigation would since the Electric  Rate Plan's freeze of base delivery <page number="49" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> rates in RY2 would be extended to RY3, while the Company in its 2015 Filing sought a revenue increase of $ 368 million. The continued base delivery  rate freeze proposed in the Joint Proposal is drastically lower than the incremental revenues the Company requested in the 2015 Filing. Overall, the parties employed a constructive process that resulted in a resolution that is balanced and provides the utility adequate financial resources to continue the provision of safe and adequate service and allows customers  to benefit from a freeze in base delivery  rates for another year.</p><p>Turning to the specifics of the Joint Proposal, as explained above, unless otherwise specifically modified in the Joint Proposal, the terms of the 2014 Rate Order would remain in effect and any provisions of the 2014 Rate Order, Appendix C that reference RY1 and RY2 for electric  shall be read to also apply to RY3, consistent with paragraph L.1 of Appendix C. Similarly, for any credits due to electric   customers  or Con Edison's recovery of costs from electric   customers  that are being amortized over a three or more year period, the Joint Proposal indicates that the revenue requirement for RY3 reflects the annual amount<page number="50" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> of such credits due electric   customers  or costs due the Company.</p><p>Because the Commission has already adopted, with certain modifications,  the 2013 Joint Proposal, the continuing provisions of the Electric  Rate Plan will not be discussed below. The Commission, however, has reviewed those provisions that will continue in RY3 to ensure that they should remain applicable. Based on that review, and the review of the Joint Proposal now before the Commission, the Joint Proposal is adopted. The issues and matters addressed below concern the specific modifications  that were made to achieve the RY3 extension and novel matters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Incremental Revenue Requirement for RY3</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Capital Spending</emphasis></p><p>According to Staff,  the capital spending in the revenue requirement for RY3 reflects information in Case 13-E-0030, which contains a full record of Con Edison's capital expenditures  for five years (through 2017), updated with information contained in the 15-E-0050 filing. This information was used to review and make adjustments to the Company's capital expenditures  for RY3. Staff  states that Con Edison's capital expenditure  plan for 2016 is driven by system expansion and reliability. For system expansion, <page number="51" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> the Joint Proposal would provide the Company with sufficient funds to ensure the provision of safe and adequate service. In addition, the Joint Proposal addresses funding for the Company's continuing storm  hardening and resiliency work. The total adjustment under the Joint Proposal to the capital spending for 2016 as updated in the 2015 Filing totals $ 26.137 million, or a revenue requirement effect of $ 2.6 million. Staff  states that the capital spending plan is based on recent cost information and recent Company performance. The capital spending plan proposed in the Joint Proposal is, therefore, reasonable and adopted.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Operations &amp; Maintenance</emphasis></p><p>In its comments, Staff  explains that it reviewed Con Edison's projected  2016 electric  O&amp;M expenses as detailed in the Company's 2015 Filing. In light of this review, Staff  determined that Con Edison required only a 0.7% increase in the O&amp;M funding level set by the Commission in the 2014 Rate Order. Staff  indicates in its comments that this increase in O&amp;M funding is significantly lower than the one-year projection of inflation of 1.9% using the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator <footnote><anchor id="fnote18_150_2193_237"/><label>18</label><bodyText><p> The GDP deflator is the Commission's standard for measuring inflation.</p></bodyText></footnote> for the 12 months ended December 2016. The level of<page number="52" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> incremental O&amp;M is, therefore, substantially less than inflation. Despite this, the incremental O&amp;M recommended under the Joint Proposal will be sufficient for the Company to provide safe and adequate electric  service in RY3. Therefore, it is adopted.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Return on Equity and Sharing  of Overearnings</emphasis></p><p>The recommended allowed ROE of 9.0% results in roughly a $ 30 million decrease to the RY3 revenue requirement, as compared to the 9.2% ROE allowed in the 2104 Rate Order. Staff  and NYC explain in their comments that the proposed ROE for RY3 reflects the current interest rate environment and comparable returns authorized by the Commission when considering the risks of the Company's operations. It is the same ROE that the Commission recently authorized in Case 14-G-0214, which also provided some form of rate relief to allow for additional capital expenditures.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote19_153_2217_5"/><label>19</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-G-0214, <emphasis typeStyle="un">KeySpan Gas East Corporation d/b/a National Grid - Authority to Defer Costs Associated with Incremental Capital Expenditures  and Other Related Relief</emphasis>, Order Directing Investments and Allowing, In Part, Deferral Authority for Costs Associated with Incremental Capital Expenditures  and Establishing A Surcharge (issued December 15, 2014) at 36.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="53" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/></p><p>The Commission reviewed the sharing  mechanism proposed in the 2014 Rate Order and found it to be reasonable as it affords the Company the opportunity to pursue efficiencies in its electric  business and to capture some of the potential benefits of efficiencies and productivity enhancements the Company may achieve. It also protects customers  by allowing for potential sharing,  should the Company's ROE be substantially greater than 9.0%. The earnings   sharing  mechanism proposed here would modify the thresholds to reflect the fact that the allowed ROE is 9.0%, not 9.2%. The Commission finds the proposed ROE and earnings   sharing  mechanism to be reasonable, thus, they are approved.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Cost of Debt</emphasis></p><p>As noted by Staff,  the proposed cost of debt for RY3 electric  reflects the current conditions in the market for Con Edison debt issuances. Staff  states that it is appropriate to update the cost of debt because it is projected  that the Company's embedded cost of unsecured debt will decrease and short-term interest rates remain highly unpredictable. Therefore, the cost rates associated with the Company's variable rate tax-exempt debt should continue to be trued-up, as under the Electric  Rate Plan. <page number="54" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> Thus, in light of these factors, the Commission finds it reasonable to adopt the cost of debt for electric  in RY3 since it will provide only what the Company needs in revenue to cover its cost of debt.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Federal Income Tax Correction</emphasis></p><p>According to its comments, Staff  discovered that the Company was, and has been for some time, flowing though duplicative tax benefits related to removal costs for ratemaking purposes. The tax benefits were flowed through to customers  once as a component of accrued book depreciation and a second time as the costs were projected  to be incurred when plant  is retired and removed from service. This error went undetected in Case 13-E-0030, as well as in prior cases. Staff  indicates that the correction of this error on a prospective basis increases the revenue requirement for RY3 by approximately $ 93 million. It is proper to make this correction going forward and the adjustment is adopted for RY3.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Deferred   Storm  Costs</emphasis></p><p>Staff  indicates in its comments that it has completed its audit of both the Non-Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Major Storm  Costs and the Superstorm Sandy Deferred  Costs. The adjustments to the Company's storm  reserve recommended by Staff  have<page number="55" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> been accepted by Con Edison. Based on its audit, Staff   recommends  that final amounts be adopted by the Commission and that these costs no longer be subject to refund. In light of Staff's  audit and conclusions, the Commission adopts the findings and recommendations of the Joint Proposal regarding these storm  costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Reconciliations </emphasis></p><p>According to the Joint Proposal, the reconciliations  established in the 2014 Rate Order would continue in RY3 using the targets reflected in Appendix 8 to the Joint Proposal, which are unchanged from RY2, except for the reconciliations  for net plant  and the variable rate component of long term debt costs. <footnote><anchor id="fnote20_163_2361_76"/><label>20</label><bodyText><p> Joint Proposal at 12-13, 17.</p></bodyText></footnote> Because these reconciliations  have allowed the capture of revenues not needed for certain cost of service items (accrual of customer  credits) for the benefit of customers,  they are important facets of the 2014 Rate Order and are adopted.</p><p>The reconciliations  hedge the risk of cost variations over a longer forecast time period. Many of these reconciled<page number="56" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> costs are largely beyond the control of Con Edison, such as property taxes, but can have a material impact on actual revenue needs. The reconciliations  hedge the risk of cost variations over the term of the Electric  Rate Plan and thus, offer protection to customers  should costs decrease; and to the Company, if the costs increase. While the reconciliations  allow for a lower ROE, they also make the Company's stock and bonds more attractive to investors due to the stabilizing effect such mechanisms have on earnings.  Thus, the reconciliation  is appropriate and is adopted.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Low Income  Reconnection Fee Waiver</emphasis></p><p>Staff,  Con Edison, and NYC support continuation of the reconnection fee waiver program. The program provides significant assistance to low income customers  who have fallen behind in their financial responsibilities to the Company, by allowing them to be reconnected to Con Edison's electric  system without paying the reconnection fee. The continuation of this program in RY3 is a benefit to low income customers  and, therefore, is adopted. The Commission notes, however, that Staff  has filed its report in the low income  proceeding, which has been issued for comment. <footnote><anchor id="fnote21_167_2430_56"/><label>21</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-M-0465, supra.</p></bodyText></footnote> The low income <page number="57" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Many noted that the proposed AMI collaborative  would work very similarly to the ongoing Storm  Hardening and Resiliency Collaborative  established by the Commission. <footnote><anchor id="fnote22_170_2471_36"/><label>22</label><bodyText><p> Case 13-E-0030, <emphasis typeStyle="un">et al</emphasis>., <emphasis typeStyle="un">supra</emphasis>, at 64-72.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="58" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/></p><p>According to the signatory parties, while the Company's business case has not been developed, the Joint Proposal reflects their general support of Con Edison's pursuit of the initiatives. The Joint Proposal provides that a collaborative  process should be established to permit the parties, including Staff,  to further consider Con Edison's AMI implementation plans based on additional information to be provided by the Company and provides the opportunity for parties to comment on such plans.</p><p>The collaborative  process to review AMI systems and expenditures  set forth in the Joint Proposal is adopted. It affords the parties and the Commission the opportunity to fully vet the Company's proposals, while offering parties the opportunity to provide input on the AMI business plan  and the functionality of the AMI system components prior to a filing with the Commission. The Commission directs that Con Edison, in developing the business plan  for and functionality of AMI consider ways in which third parties can be an active partner in realizing the totality of the benefits that can be extracted from this technology and information. For example, the Company should consider whether third party ownership<page number="59" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The business plan  shall also incorporate lessons learned from demonstration projects that incorporate innovative pricing and business models that will allow the utilities to both reduce the expense and gain the full value of advanced communication and AMI implementation. The Commission also expects that the AMI business plan  address third-party access to AMI meter  data, as required under the Joint Proposal. <footnote><anchor id="fnote24_173_2520_217"/><label>24</label><bodyText><p> Joint Proposal, at 16.</p></bodyText></footnote> Moreover, Con Edison is directed to explore how AMI can help facilitate the integration of DER resources into the Distributed System Platform (DSP) associated with REV.</p><p><page number="60" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Standby  Service</emphasis></p><p>As discussed above, the Joint Proposal recommends  that the Commission adopt three changes to the current Standby   tariff.  As Staff,  CPA, NYC, CPA, NYECC, and PACE state in their comments, changes to the Company's Standby  Service were proposed to expand and enhance the benefits of customers'   generating  facilities. Currently, the Monthly Adjustment Clause (MAC) is assessed on Standby   customer  accounts billed, pursuant to the electric   tariff  (P.S.C. No. 10), through three components: 1) the Customer  Charge (collected through the MAC); 2) the Contract Demand Charge (collected through the MAC); and, 3) the As-used Daily Demand Charge (also collected through the MAC). Under the proposal, the three MAC charge components would be replaced with a single per-kWh MAC charge applicable to Standby   customers,  similar to the per-kWh MAC charge applicable to all other customers  taking service under P.S.C. No. 10. As correctly noted by Staff,  Con Edison and NYC, this change benefits customers  because it simplifies the calculation of the MAC charge to these customers,  allowing them to more easily verify the charges incurred.</p><p>For the second change, which would apply to Offset   customers, <page number="61" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> the Joint Proposal recommends  that the assessment of per-kWh charges for such customers  be based on the customer's  total usage net of kWh produced by the customer's   generating  facility. According to Staff,  Con Edison and NYC, the purpose of this change is to revise the assessment of per-kWh charges to be consistent with the as-used daily demand charge, which is based on net metered demand.</p><p>The Joint Proposal also recommends  that the Commission allow the Company to provide Standby   customers  of Con Edison and NYPA the opportunity to earn performance-based credits against their contract demand charges based on the performance of their generating  facilities. Parties recognize that this is not a comprehensive solution for properly valuing contributions by Distributed Energy Resource (DER) providers, but rather an interim measure designed to capture data and allow for a more robust design process in future proceedings before the Commission. This credit program will allow generators to show they can perform reliably as distribution level system assets and help significantly advance the policies outlined in the REV proceeding.</p><p>The proposal that, for 2015, the requirements be modified to allow<page number="62" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> an alternative by using a Meter  Data Service Provider to verify performance during the 2015 test period only is adopted because the modification  is a practical solution to the metering  and communications problem. It will further facilitate customers'  ability to reap the benefits of the generation assets they own and removes a barrier to advancing the Commission's REV policies.</p><p>In their comments, Staff,  CPA, NYC, PACE, and NYPA state that the performance mechanism proposed for Standby  customers  should be approved because they expand and recognize the benefits of customers'  reliable generating  facilities. Standby  customers  will now have the opportunity to prove the reliability of their generating  facilities and to be rewarded for such performance. For the Company, it allows measurement  and verification of Standby  customers'  generating  units and thus provides critical information necessary for Con Edison to incorporate distributed generation into its system planning process. All of these benefits may provide useful information for future proceedings, are goals of the REV proceeding, and forward the REV agenda, while allowing for changes to the program, if necessary, when determinations<page number="63" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> on Standby  rates have been made by the Commission in the Track Two REV process. The Commission adopts the changes to Standby  Service as proposed in the Joint Proposal and addendum.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Comments of Local 1-2</emphasis></p><p>Local 1-2 does not oppose the Joint Proposal, but requests that the Commission not adopt it unless adoption is conditioned on the imposition of two additional commitments. The first is that Con Edison follow its own July 2010 Human Resources - Guidance Memo when deciding whether to use contractors or its in-house employees to perform work. The second is that the Company implements a program to recruit and hire veterans and inner-city youths for its internal work force.</p><p>As the Union notes, there is already an ongoing proceeding (Case 13-M-0449) which is investigating these issues in a focused operations audit of the major utilities. Thus, it would be premature to address the Union's proposals prior to a final report in that proceeding. Therefore, the Union may raise these issues in the Company's next general rate proceeding, which should occur after the final report in 13-M-0449 is expected to be issued.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Residential Customers  - Advanced Meter  Concerns</emphasis></p><p>A number of residential<page number="64" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Many do not want such meters  installed or request that their AMR meter  be replaced by a traditional meter  because they perceive potential health, fire, and/or privacy impacts. The Commission is encouraged that, under the Joint Proposal, the AMI collaborative  will afford the opportunity to discuss these issues and requires that the Company's AMI business plan,  which will be presented to the Commission for review and action, address customer  engagement and privacy principles. This should afford the parties the opportunity to discuss potential health concerns as well. In addition, the Commission notes that there are pending petitions by Con Edison to allow customers  to "opt-out" of the use of an AMR or AMI meter  to measure their electric  and gas consumption. <footnote><anchor id="fnote25_186_2771_26"/><label>25</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-E-0570, <emphasis typeStyle="un">Tariff  filing by Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. to establish General Rule 6.10 - AMR/AMI Meter  Opt-Out contained in P.S.C.

The annual levelized<page number="75" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

PSC Account 456-Other Electric  Revenues has and/or will be debited/credited with the offset  recorded in PSC Account 256-Regulatory Liabilities. Interest on the outstanding balance is accruing at the Other Customer  Provided Capital Rate. The amount to be deferred  for the benefit of customers  at December<page number="76" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> 31, 2015 is approximately $ 30 million.</p><p>Since these two annual levelized rate changes result in lower base rates at the end of the original two-year term of the 2014 Electric  Rate Plan than base rates would otherwise be under an on-levelized approach, $ 47,776 million of the levelized change in RY2 was effectuated in RY2 via class-specific temporary credits. Under the 2014 Electric  Rate Plan, such credits were set to be effective  only for the duration of RY2. The credits, which are shown on statements filed separately from the Company's rate schedules, are being credited in the same manner as if they were credited in non-competitive delivery  base rates. Therefore, RY2 delivery  rates were set to reflect revenues that are $ 47,776 million greater than the levelized RY2 revenue level. During RY2, the $ 47,776 million is being offset  by the temporary credits. In addition, in the 2014 Rate Order, the Commission ordered the approximate $ 30 million customer  credit discussed above to be applied to reduce customer  bills in the year after RY2 if rates are not otherwise reset by the Commission for that year.</p><p>This 2015 Joint Proposal reflects an increase in the Company's revenue requirement <page number="77" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 269"/> in RY3 of $ 74,857 million, in addition to the $ 47,776 million increase approved by the Commission in the 2014 Rate Order. In order to effectuate no change in RY3 electric   delivery  service base rates, the Company will recognize in other operating revenues $ 92.6 million of customer  credits, in addition to the approximate $ 30 million of customer  credits discussed above. The accounting for the customer  credits in RY3 as shown on Appendix 1, page 5 of 5, to this 2015 Joint Proposal will result in a debit to PSC Account 256-Regulatory Liabilities and a credit to PSC Account 456-Other Electric  Revenues.</p><p>Therefore, electric  base delivery  rates established for RY2 will continue in RY3 unchanged and the $ 47,776 million of class-specific temporary credits will be effective  only for the duration of RY2 and RY3. At the end of RY3, the temporary credits will expire and the delivery  rates will remain in effect.</p><p>The Company will continue to recover on an annual basis $ 248.8 million through the Rate Adjustment Clause ("RAC") pending a Commission determination in Case 09-M-0114.</p><p>The major components of the electric  revenue requirement underlying this Proposal are set forth in Appendix 1 to this<page number="78" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.
