These modifications  include 13 administrative changes and 108 specific performance measurement  process changes (metric   deletions) .</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">BACKGROUND</emphasis></h><p>The Inter-Carrier  Service Quality Guidelines  (C2C Guidelines)  establish standards and metrics  for measuring and reporting  Verizon New York Inc.'s (Verizon) and Frontier of Rochester, Inc's (Frontier) inter-carrier  service quality performance. <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_13_115_41"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> Case 97-C-0139, Order Adopting Inter-Carrier  Service Quality Guidelines  (issued February 16, 1999).</p></bodyText></footnote> The C2C Guidelines  provide the metrics  and performance standards applicable to Verizon's and to Frontier's wholesale operations. They include comprehensive explanations of the standards' definitions, reporting  levels, measurement  methodologies, geography covered, current product intervals, and glossary and appendices that provide further explanatory material.</p><p><page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/></p><p>Since the adoption of the C2C Guidelines  in 1999, the Carrier Working Group (CWG), with an active membership that includes Department of Public Service Staff (Staff) and the major incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) and competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) operating in New York State, meets regularly to discuss issues relating to the Guidelines.  From time-to-time the CWG has collaboratively recommended   modifications  to the C2C Guidelines  to reflect changes in market conditions; the most recent modification  occurred by Commission Order dated December 1, 2010. CWG is now proposing new consensus changes, as discussed below, for additional modifications  to the C2C guidelines.  Staff recommends that the Commission adopt these proposed modifications. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">DISCUSSION</emphasis></h><p>The Commission has periodically ordered modifications  to the C2C Guidelines  to address industry changes, competitive issues, technological improvements, and other factors. In an effort to keep the C2C Guidelines  current, numerous proposed modifications  are recommended  here.</p><p>The proposed modifications  to the C2C Guidelines  are classified into two categories: non-process changes of an administrative nature; and, changes<page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/> that affect the manner in which a performance measurement  is processed (<emphasis typeStyle="un">i.e</emphasis>., whether and/or how a measurement  is calculated). The modifications  discussed herein consist of 13 administrative changes and 108 process changes (metric   deletions) . These modifications  were discussed and reviewed at a number of CWG meetings. The CWG unanimously reached consensus on all of the proposed changes.</p><p>Pursuant to the State Administrative Procedures Act, a Notice of Proposed Agency Action to modify the C2C Guidelines  was published in the State Register on October 15, 2014 (SAPA No. 97-C-0139SP34). No comments were received.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Administrative Changes</emphasis></p><p>The 13 proposed administrative modifications  to the C2C Guidelines  are detailed in Section A of the Attachment hereto. In sum, these changes are as follows: (1) update  C2C Guidelines'  Appendix  - Table; (2) update  the URL links listed in the Guidelines;  (3) remove references to the toll-free Help Desk number; (4) update  the URL for access to the Help Desk; (5) update  the Pre-Ordering Performance table to reflect that the PO-7 (Software Problem Resolution Timeliness) and PO-8 (Manual Loop  Qualification) metrics  have one sub-metric  each; (6) update <page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/> the Ordering Performance table to correct the alignment of the names of the metric  functions; (7) replace  text describing actual Service Order Processor (SOP) Downtimes  with an URL for the OR-1-02 sub-metric  (% on time LSRC - Flow Through) to direct readers to the current SOP Availability; (8) replace  text describing SOP start times during exceptional circumstances (exception clause) for the OR-1-02 sub-metric  with an URL to direct readers to the post release SOP availability; (9) replace  text describing actual SOP Downtimes  with an URL for OR-2-02 (% On Time Local Service Request (LSR) Reject (Flow-through) ) and Local Service Request (LSRC) - Flow Through) to direct readers to the current SOP availability; (10) replace  text to the exception clause for OR-2-02 with an URL to direct readers to the post release SOP start times; (11) delete  Appendix  G - Disposition Code and Cause Code data and mark the appendix  as 'Reserved for Future Use' as the Guidelines'  URL page states the most current description of the Disposition Codes and Cause Codes; (12) delete  Appendix  H - 'Flow Through Ordering Scenarios  and mark the appendix  as 'Reserved for Future Use' as the Guidelines  URL page points<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/> to the most current Flow Through Ordering Scenarios;  and (13) update  Appendix  O to reflect the current testing scenarios  as, over time, the products in the Test Deck have changed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Process Changes (Metric   Deletions) </emphasis></p><p>The CWG performed an analysis to determine whether to delete  or consolidate C2C metrics  with little or no activity. The CWG analyzed reported metric  date and identified the minimum and maximum operational volumes  that occurred during the 12-month period between March 2013 and February 2014. A general annual benchmark of 20 CLEC observations or less was used to flag "low volume"   metrics  for consideration by the CWG for possible deletion.  Process changes, as detailed in Section B of the Attachment hereto, are proposed for 108 of the total of 341 sub-metrics  in the current C2C Guidelines.  These process modifications  are organized according to the general categories (<emphasis typeStyle="un">e.g</emphasis>., Order Confirmation Timeliness, Pre-Ordering Performance, Maintenance and Repair, and Network Performance) in the C2C Guidelines.  The process changes involve the removal  of those low volume  or no activity metrics  which the CWG agreed could be deleted.  Some of the reasons for the lack of metric  activity<page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/> included changes in the industry which resulted in wholesale products no longer being ordered or in wholesale interfaces no longer used by certain CLECs.</p><p>1. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Pre-Ordering Performance</emphasis></p><p>The PO-2 (OSS Interface Availability) metrics  are measurements  of the time during which the OSS Interface is actually available as a percentage of scheduled  availability.</p><p>2. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Ordering Performance</emphasis></p><p>The OR-1 (Order Confirmation Timeliness) metrics  measure the amount of time elapsed between receipt of a valid order request and receipt of a service order confirmation acknowledgement. There are many sub-metrics  associated with this metric  that have product specific deviations (<emphasis typeStyle="un">e.g</emphasis>., Resale Specials DSO, DS1, DS3 and UNE Specials DSO, DS1, DS3, 2-Wire xDSL Loop,  Non-DSO, DS1 &amp; DS3). Depending on the specific product, an order request with six or more associated lines may or may not require a physical facility check.</p><p>The OR-2 (Reject Timeliness) metrics  measures the amount of elapsed time between receipt of a valid order request and the receipt of a service order reject acknowledgement.</p><p>3. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Provisioning Performance</emphasis></p><p>PR-1 (Average Interval Offered) metrics  measure the average number of business days<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/> between the order date and the committed completion date.</p><p>The PR-3 (Completed Within a Specific Number of Days) metrics  measure the percent of POTS orders completed in specified numbers of business days, between application and work completion dates.</p><p>The PR-4 (Missed  Appointments) performance metrics  measure the percent of orders completed after the due date.</p><p>The PR-5 (Facility Missed  Orders) metrics  measure facility missed  orders with calculations for the report month including orders complete in the billing system.</p><p>The PR-6 (Installation Quality) metrics  measure the percent of lines/circuits/trunks  installed where a reported trouble  was found in the Verizon network within 30 days of order completion.</p><p>The PR-8 (Percent Open Orders in a Hold Status) metrics  measure the number of open orders that, at the close of the reporting  period, remain in a hold status for more than 30 or 90 calendar days, as a percentage of orders completed in the reporting  period.</p><p>4. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Maintenance and Repair Performance</emphasis></p><p>The MR-1 (Response Time OSS Maintenance Interface) metrics  measures the response time defined as the time, in seconds, that elapses from receipt of a request at Verizon's access platform to<page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/> issuance of a response from Verizon's access platform.</p><p>The MR-2 (Trouble  Report Rate) metrics  measure the total initial contact, via a customer direct call or a customer referred call, per 100 lines/circuits/trunks  in service.</p><p>The MR-3 (Missed  repair Appointments) metrics  measure the percent of reported Network Troubles  not repaired and cleared by the date and time committed.</p><p>The MR-4 (Trouble  Duration Intervals) performance metrics  measure the average interval from when the trouble  is received to when the trouble  is cleared for various products.</p><p>The MR-5 (Repair Trouble  Reports) metrics  measure the percent of troubles  closed that have an additional trouble  closed within 30 days for which a network trouble  is found.</p><p>5. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Network Performance</emphasis></p><p>The NP-1 (Percent final Trunk  Group Blockage) performance metric  measures the percent of dedicated one-way Final Trunk  Groups (FTGs) carrying traffic from Verizon's tandem to the CLEC that exceed blocking design threshold.</p><p>The NP-2 (Collocation Performance) metric  includes physical collocation arrangement products ordered and provisioned  via state tariffs.</p><p>There are 15 proposed administrative modifications  to the Process Changes referenced in<page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/> Section C of Attachment 1. In sum, as a result of metric   deletions,  there is no longer a need for them to be referenced and they are as follows: (1) update  the table regarding OR-13 "% of Large Job Hot Cut Project Negotiations Completed"; (2) the PR-1-09 UNE EEL and IOF metrics  will be removed; (3) removal  of the 6701 Product Code due to the deletion  of the NP-1-01 and NP-1-02 metrics;  (3) move Products listed under Metrics  for PO-2 and update  the reported products; (5) update  the table regarding PR-1 and PR-3 so the table reflects the accurate number of sub-metrics;  (6) remove the text regarding EEL and IOF due to the removal  of PR-1-09-3511, PR-109-3513 and PR-1-09-3530; (7) remove references to PR-1-04, PR1-05 and PR-1-13; (8) remove the references to PR-1-09 UNE IOF, UNE-EEL-Loop and UNE-EEL Backbone; (9) remove references to PR3-11, PR-3-12 and PR-3-13; (10) remove references to PR-3-103341, PR-3-11, PR-3-12 and PR-3-13; (11) remove references to PR-4-2-Wire Digital; (12) update  the table regarding MR-1 as it will change from 12 to 10 sub-metrics;  (13) remove references to MR-1-04 and MR-1-09; adjust the references to MR-2-01 Performance Standards; (14) update  the table regarding<page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 222"/> NP-1 and (15) remove the text regarding NP-1-01 and NP-1-02.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">CONCLUSION</emphasis></h><p>The proposed modifications  agreed to by the CWG are reasonable and will streamline the C2C Guidelines  to incorporate industry practices, and facilitate compliance. The proposed modifications  represent the consensus recommendations  of the CWG and should be adopted by the Commission. The CWG will continue to evaluate metric  performance and propose modifications  to the C2C guidelines  on an as needed basis.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">RECOMMENDATION </emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">It is recommended  that</emphasis>:</p><p>1.
