As part of this process, the proceeding on Dynamic Load  Management (DLM) was initiated on December 15, 2014 in the DLM Order. <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_10_85_255"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-E-0423, <emphasis typeStyle="un">Dynamic Load  Management Programs</emphasis>, Order Instituting Proceeding Regarding Dynamic Load  Management and Directing Tariff  Filings (issued December 15, 2014).</p></bodyText></footnote> There, it was explained that DLM strategies, including Demand Response (DR), can provide a number of system and public policy benefits consistent with the REV objectives, including reliability,  economic, and environmental benefits. These benefits also include deferral or avoidance of distribution or bulk power infrastructure spending, improvement of overall system efficiency, and furtherance of system reliability  and resiliency.</p><p><page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/></p><p>In the DLM Order, the Commission recognized that Consolidated Edison of New York, Inc. (Con Edison) had implemented and developed distribution-level DR programs in response to Commission directives and was deriving substantial benefits from those programs. Based on this existing experience, it was determined that distribution-level DR programs are proven "no regrets" cost effective programs, for which immediate implementation was appropriate.</p><p>For these reasons all electric  distribution utilities without dynamic load  management (DLM programs) were directed to develop DLM programs and file draft tariffs  for such programs for implementation for the summer of 2015. <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_14_132_71"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> Case 14-E-0423, <emphasis typeStyle="un">supra</emphasis>, Order Instituting Proceeding Regarding Dynamic Load  Management and Directing Tariff  Filings (issued December 15, 2014).</p></bodyText></footnote> Draft tariff  filings were received from Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric  Corporation (Central Hudson), New York State Electric  &amp; Gas Corporation (NYSEG), Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation d/b/a National Grid (Niagara Mohawk), Rochester Gas and Electric  Corporation <page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> (RG&amp;E), and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&amp;R) (jointly, the utilities), on March 23, 2015.</p><p>In this order, those draft tariffs  are approved with modifications and each utility is directed to submit final tariffs  as a compliance filing with an effective date of July 1, 2015. This will allow the DLM programs to begin operation this summer. Since significant expansion of several of the programs for the summer 2016 period is expected, each utility shall make a filing before January 7, 2016 proposing those changes and such other changes as are deemed appropriate. Each utility shall also file an annual report on DLM programs.</p><p>The DLM programs adopted today will be instrumental in the delivery of longer term benefits to New Yorkers, including avoiding or delaying transmission and distribution system investment, promoting energy  efficiency, and improving the reliability <page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> and resiliency of electricity delivery systems. These programs, however, are only a first step to addressing the development of DLM. It is expected that Department of Public Service Staff (Staff) will continue to facilitate stakeholder discussions on developing innovative programs to address market needs, leveraging the resources that these programs will produce, and complementing other third-party product and service offerings. Demonstration projects developed through REV will also reveal opportunities for integration of dynamic load  management into utility systems. These developments will continue in parallel as the REV proceeding moves forward. DLM programs will ultimately be integrated into utility system planning and operations and be accomplished by market mechanisms.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">BACKGROUND</emphasis></h><p>In the DLM Order, the utilities were directed to work with Staff and other stakeholders to develop DLM programs using the guidelines in the appendix attached to that order. The guidelines included three types of DLM programs: (1) a peak  shaving program that can be called on a day-ahead basis when next-day forecast load  approaches the forecast summer system peak   load;  (2) a local distribution reliability <page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> program that can be called in order to address local reliability  issues in specific defined electrical or geographic areas; and (3) a direct load  control (DLC) program allowing customers  to install a device that can be controlled remotely by the utility (control device)  to directly switch load  on and off. Those DLM programs should be designed to reflect the value of system reliability,  system efficiency, integration of renewable resources, avoidable costs, customer  bill management, and should reflect the marginal cost of avoided transmission and distribution investments on as granular a basis as possible. The utilities were cautioned that, while program differences such as locational avoided costs, payments, and load   reduction  periods might differ from area to area and program to program, differences between DLM programs throughout the State should be minimized.</p><p>The utilities were also directed to consider a number of different DLM program payment options, including: (1) reservation  payments; (2) performance payments; and (3) sign-up or participation payments. Reservation  payments are those payments made to participants on at a set dollar per kilowatt (kW) per month of the summer <page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/>  capability  period basis, regardless of whether or not the utility calls its demand response programs. These reservation  payments compensate DLM program participants for standing ready to supply demand response when called upon by the utility.</p><p>Performance payments are those payments made to customers  on a dollar per kilowatt-hour (kWh) basis only during called demand response events. Performance payments compensate customers  for actually reducing load  on the utility's system during the called event or test hours, and can also be used to induce participants to voluntarily continue to reduce load  during called hours after the mandatory load   reduction  obligations have expired.</p><p>Sign-up or participation payments are those payments made upon enrolling in a DLM program and installing any necessary equipment (in the case of sign-up payments), or to induce customers  to participate in called demand response events. Sign-up payments are generally made on a dollar per device enrolled in DLC programs basis once the control device  is installed and the utility is able to confirm communications with the control device.  Sign-up payments compensate participants for enrolling control devices in the utility's<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> DLC program and for surrendering some control over the operation of the load  device during called demand response events.</p><p>Participation payments are generally made on a dollar per year at the end of a summer capability  period basis when the DLM program participant has met a minimum threshold of participation in called demand response events. The participation payment is used as a financial incentive that encourages participants to forgo overriding utility control of their enrolled control devices during called demand response events.</p><p>In the DLM guidelines, distribution level demand response programs already in effect in the Con Edison service territory  were identified as models that could serve as a guide and example to other utilities. Specifically, these programs include the Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP), the Distribution Load  Relief Program (DLRP), and the DLC program. <footnote><anchor id="fnote4_24_297_48"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p> A detailed summary of the tariff  filings by the utilities has been attached to this order as Appendix A.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE</emphasis><page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

While distribution-level demand response programs have been available in the Con Edison service territory  for over a decade, opening the remainder of the State to participation in such programs represents the next step in the REV initiatives. While the DLM programs proposed by the utilities are not perfect, as discussed below, they represent a solid first step and learning experience.</p><p>The utilities have cooperated in developing and implementing these important programs on an expedited basis for the summer of 2015. Therefore, with the exception of the provisions discussed below, the utilities' proposed DLM programs<page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> and tariff  provisions are approved. The utilities are directed to submit tariff  leaves in compliance with this Order to become effective on July 1, 2015, on not less than one day's notice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Reporting Requirements</emphasis></p><p>The utilities are directed to perform assessments of the performance and cost-effectiveness of their individual DLM programs after each summer capability  period. Each utility is directed to file a report on or before December 1 of each year detailing its evaluation of its DLM programs. These reports shall contain, at a minimum: (1) recommendations that each utility would propose to their DLM program tariff  provisions to be implemented for the following summer capability  period; (2) a detailed breakdown of DLM program costs, by program, including incentives payments made to customers,  program operation costs for both the utility and vendors engaged in these programs, equipment costs including software and any equipment provided to customers  (such as control devices), measurement and verification costs, and DLM program marketing costs; (3) total and new program enrollment for the summer capability  period; (4) a summary of demand response program performance during each<page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> called event; and (5) evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of each program using the Total Resource Cost (TRC) test, Utility Cost Test (UCT), and Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM).</p><p>The utilities should consider using the most recent report submitted by Con Edison as a template for their own reports. <footnote><anchor id="fnote7_35_403_481"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p> Case 09-E-0115, <emphasis typeStyle="un">Proceeding on Motion of the Commission to Consider Demand Response Initiatives</emphasis> (2014 Consolidated Edison Demand Response Evaluation) (filed December 1, 2014).</p></bodyText></footnote> The utilities are directed to conform their cost-effectiveness calculations to the guidelines for Benefit-Cost Analysis which will be promulgated in the REV Proceeding. Each of the utilities is also directed to submit a petition seeking to implement its proposed DLM program changes, as well as those directed herein, to become effective for the summer 2016 capability  period on or before January 7, 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Development of Incentives and Payments</emphasis></p><p>Many of the utilities did not monetize or plan to compensate DLM program participants for the full<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> range of benefits that were envisioned and anticipated in the DLM Order. For example, the incentive payment structures of the peak  shaving programs developed by Central Hudson, NYSEG, and RG&amp;E are all predicated solely upon the avoided cost of wholesale capacity market obligations.</p><p>In contrast, the development and adoption of a benefit cost analysis (BCA) framework in the REV proceeding will examine all the potential benefits and costs such as avoided wholesale capacity and energy  obligation costs, avoided environmental externalities, avoided line losses, and any avoided load  growth or reliability-driven avoided transmission and distribution infrastructure costs including avoided O&amp;M. Monetizing these benefits may require utilities to develop and file marginal distribution cost studies granular to the substation level. The concerns AEMA and NRG express regarding the transparency of the DLM program pricing that will result from these studies, is ameliorated because the stakeholder process that will be undertaken in the REV Proceeding will identify and quantify the various costs and benefits included and compensated for in the utilities DLM programs. In the interim, the utilities are<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> expected to determine the most efficacious application of the BCA framework to proposed DLM program changes going forward while also taking into account impacts on program enrollment and third party provider business continuity.</p><p>In proposing an Asset Utilization Tariff,  NYBEST furnishes an example of an innovative program that might be used to address future market needs and complement third-party product and service offerings. When further developing their DLM programs in the future, the utilities should consider the value to the electric  system of assets that are simultaneously flexible and yield multiple value streams. NYBEST's request for more geographically and temporally-specific data will be resolved when the utilities file their Distributed System Implementation Plans as required in the REV proceeding.</p><p>Comverge presents proposed changes to the utilities' DLC program payments worth considering. As it points out, benefits can be realized from incentives that spur investment in the highest value load  control devices, locating control devices in the highest value areas of the utilities' service territories,  discouraging mid-event opt-outs, and settling payments for demand response<page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> performance on an individual basis rather than on a program-wide basis. While we are accepting the utilities' proposed payment structures for the summer of 2015, these concepts advanced by Comverge should be considered more thoroughly by the utilities when developing their proposed program changes to be effective for the summer of 2016. Therefore, the utilities are directed to address, in their DLM program reports and proposed tariff  changes, whether these revisions would be feasible and beneficial in their individual programs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Customer  Eligibility and Participation</emphasis></p><p>As AEMA and NRG maintain, DLM programs should be broadly available to all customers  willing and able to participate in all portions of the various utility service territories  in New York. State-wide DLM programs available to all customers  will yield greater benefits to participants, ratepayers, and society, and will also serve as important learning opportunities for every utility. In general, all customers  willing to meet metering  and other eligibility requirements, regardless of rate class, hourly  pricing status, or participation in the NYISO's SCR program, should be allowed to participate in the valuable distribution-level<page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> DLM programs.</p><p>As AEMA and NRG state, only offering DLM programs in certain areas of the utilities' service territories  leaves substantial benefits unrealized throughout the State. In the limited timeframe remaining to implement these DLM programs for the summer of 2015, however, the utilities' proposals create demand response opportunities in the areas where they are needed most by identifying and targeting demand response in the highest value areas of their service territories.  While the specified designated  areas that the utilities proposed in their tariffs  for the purposes of effectuating these programs for the summer of 2015 are therefore accepted, the utilities are directed to expand their DLM program offerings service-territory wide for 2016, with appropriate pricing signals to spur participation where it is needed most. Petitions to effectuate the needed tariff  changes for summer 2016 shall be filed on or before January 7, 2016.</p><p>One modification, however, to the locational provisions is needed for 2015. The tariff  leaves NYSEG and RG&amp;E submitted do not clearly identify the participation areas for their respective CSRP and DLRP programs. NYSEG and RG&amp;E are directed to amend <page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> their filings to precisely designate the areas where the CSRP and DLRP programs will be available, if limited to designated  areas, under the applicability section of their tariffs. </p><p>NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and Central Hudson seem to believe that the primary benefit of CSRP is reducing the need to purchase capacity in the wholesale market. Since customers  that both participate in CSRP and are on hourly  pricing are individually assigned capacity tags in the market and will therefore directly benefit from their own reduced usage during peak  periods, NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and Central Hudson determined that also providing such customers  with a payment for the same value stream would constitute a double-payment. Central Hudson cites this argument as its reasoning for precluding dual DLM and SCR program participation.</p><p>In the specific scenarios presented by NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and Central Hudson where the only assumed benefit of their CSRPs is avoided wholesale capacity costs, paying hourly  pricing customers  for reducing their demand during the New York Control Area system peak  when those customers  are already realizing a benefit from that reduction  would be an inappropriate cross-subsidization from all customers  to <page number="17" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/>  hourly  pricing participants. However, as described above, peak   load   reduction  creates other benefits that were not captured in the filings of NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and Central Hudson and serve as justification for additional compensation to the participants. The primary objective of distribution-level demand response programs is to reduce load  during distribution system peaks  in order to avoid expensive distribution infrastructure upgrades otherwise needed to meet those peaks.  To that end, the value of avoided wholesale market capacity costs should not be included when setting distribution-level demand response program payments when such values are provided through other programs such as the NYISO SCR program. Therefore, Central Hudson, NYSEG, and RG&amp;E shall make any necessary tariff  changes to allow Mandatory Hourly  Pricing and Voluntary Hourly  Pricing customers  to fully participate in both the Reservation  and Voluntary options of their respective CSRP programs in summer 2015.</p><p>NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and Central Hudson are directed to redesign their proposed CSRP payments based on the guidance above coupled with the best cost information currently available, whether it be a recent marginal cost study<page number="18" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> or the latest embedded cost of service study, for summer 2015 as part of their respective compliance filings to be effective on July 1. NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and Central Hudson are directed to develop and submit, within 90 days of the date of this order, detailed marginal distribution cost studies for the purposes of designing their respective DLM program payment structures for the summer of 2016. NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and Central Hudson are directed to make use of such marginal cost studies when developing their DLM program payment structures for the summer of 2016 as part of their respective petitions to be filed with the Secretary to the Commission on or before January 7, 2016.</p><p>As suggested in AEMA's comments, customers  shall be permitted to enroll  in both the SCR program conducted by the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) and utility CSRPs. NYISO SCR program participants benefit wholesale market reliability,  whereas the demand response CSRP participants furnish serves different purposes with different value streams, as described above. As a result, individual customers  shall be permitted to enroll  and fully participate in both programs. To accomplish this result, Central Hudson <page number="19" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> shall revise its tariffs  to allow its CSRP participants to simultaneously enroll  in the NYISO SCR program. The utility shall include in those revisions provisions mirroring those currently in place under Con Edison's CSRP for performance payments it will make to customers  who enroll  in both programs and respond to simultaneous CSRP and NYISO SCR program events.</p><p>As AEMA contends, customers  with demands between 100 kW and 250 kW should not be precluded from participating in Niagara Mohawk's demand response programs. All customers,  regardless of rate class, should be able to participate in any DLM program offering provided that the customer  is willing to meet the metering  and other program eligibility requirements. Small customers  that are unable to support large load  reductions  by themselves are still valuable to the system as demand response assets and shall be allowed to participate through an aggregator,  and Niagara Mohawk is directed to revise its tariffs  accordingly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Generator Requirements and Dispatch Criteria</emphasis></p><p>An important category of demand response program benefits is reductions  to emissions from electric  generation facilities. In general, to the extent that generating <page number="20" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> units support load   reductions  during demand response events, their use should not result in a net increase in air pollution. While most of the utilities included provisions precluding older, less efficient, and dirtier generating units from being used to provide load   reductions  within peak  shaving programs, Central Hudson's tariffs  lack these provisions. Therefore, Central Hudson is directed to adopt the requisite provisions that limit diesel-fired generating unit participation in its CSRP to only those units of vintage year 2000 or newer and limiting the total kW enrollment of these units to 20% of the total kW enrolled in its CSRP.</p><p>AEMA states that the DLRP dispatch criteria defined by the various utilities should mirror those used by Con Edison in order to ensure that emergency  generation units can be used to provide load  reduction  during DLRP events. Conforming to the precedent set by Con Edison will ensure that emergency  generation units are available for use during system emergencies  and in compliance with the EPA's applicable regulations. Furthermore, conforming all utility dispatch criteria to a single standard will help minimize variation in the operation of demand response<page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> programs throughout the State. Therefore, NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and Niagara Mohawk are directed to revise their DLRP dispatch criteria to conform to those in effect at Con Edison.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Application Deadlines  and Commencement  Dates</emphasis></p><p>According to AEMA, the normal month-ahead deadline  for applications to participate in DLM programs should be shortened. If that timeframe were imposed for summer 2015, the earliest most customers  would be able to participate in these programs would be the months of August and September. Instead, since the need for demand response is often greatest in July, the time between receiving an accepted application should be reduced for summer 2015 in order to open participation in these programs when it is needed most.</p><p>There are, however, operational constraints on the administration of these programs. To limit enrollment to customers  whose participation can be incorporated rapidly, the utilities are directed to allow customers  who already have installed interval   metering  and associated communications, and who meet the other eligibility requirements, to participate in their DLM programs as of July 1, 2015 if such customers  submit a completed application on or before June<page number="22" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> 24, 2015. The utilities are directed to accept completed applications from all customers,  regardless of whether such customers  already have interval   metering  or not, submitted by July 1, 2015 for an August 1, 2015 commencement  date, to be effective for the summer of 2015 only. The utilities shall make the necessary revisions to their tariffs  to effectuate these revised application deadlines  and commencement  dates.</p><p>In general, the utilities conformed to the application deadlines  in place at Con Edison allowing customers  to submit a completed application by April 1 for a May 1 commencement  date, or by May 1 for a June 1 commencement  date, for years after 2015. Moreover, NYSEG and RG&amp;E did not tariff  for their respective DLRP programs the option for customers  to apply by May 1 for a June 1 commencement  date. NYSEG and RG&amp;E shall amend their DLRP tariffs  to provide for that option.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">DLM Program Cost Recovery</emphasis></p><p>The filings by NYSEG, RG&amp;E, and O&amp;R follow Con Edison's method of recovering DLM program costs through a non-bypassable delivery charge collected from all customers  on a dollar per kWh usage basis. That approach is accepted. Central Hudson proposed deferring its incurred DLM <page number="23" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> program costs until a non-bypassable delivery charge can be promulgated. Accordingly, it shall develop and submit a proposal to institute a non-bypassable delivery charge for recovery of these costs within 90 days.</p><p>On its part, Niagara Mohawk proposed to allocate costs to customers  in its various service classes and recover those costs on the basis of both dollar per kW demand, where applicable, and dollar per kWh usage. Niagara Mohawk also proposed to institute a new Demand Response surcharge line item that would appear directly on customer  bills. While Niagara Mohawk's service class allocation on the basis of both demand and usage reflects the REV vision for the future, its proposal to implement a new surcharge line item on customer  bills is unnecessary since it has an existing rate mechanism that can used for this purpose. Allocating DLM program costs in the same way that other utility costs are allocated represents a step forward to seamlessly integrating DLM programs into regular utility operations. Therefore Niagara Mohawk is directed to recover the costs for its DLM programs within the existing Service Delivery Charge on each Customer's  bill based on the Customer's  respective<page number="24" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> service class similarly to how other usual utility costs, as allocated to the demand and energy  components of that Charge, are recovered. Niagara Mohawk is directed to file monthly statements reporting the DLM program cost portion of the delivery bill.</p><p>Finally, Niagara Mohawk proposed that it collect an incentive equal to 10% of the deferred capital costs of its Kenmore distribution project where its DLM programs are targeted. We defer decision on this issue to Track II of the REV proceeding, where the issue of utility incentives will be explored in greater detail.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Other Modifications to Improve DLM Program Uniformity</emphasis></p><p>As stated in the DLM Order, and as NRG and AEMA emphasized, DLM program uniformity across the State should be maintained to the greatest extent possible. Uniformity of DLM programs among utilities eases learning curves for customers  and aggregators,  who may participate in similar programs in different utility service territories.  To that end, we direct a number of modifications to the utilities' DLM program tariffs. </p><p>First, Niagara Mohawk shall change the name of its the Peak  Shaving Load  Relief program to the Commercial System Relief Program to maintain a single<page number="25" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> nomenclature for peak  shaving programs across the State. Niagara Mohawk shall implement this change as part of its compliance filing.</p><p>Second, NYSEG and RG&amp;E will be the only utilities that lack Bring Your Own Thermostat (BYOT) options in their respective DLC programs. Since the BYOT option has been popular, and is generally more cost-effective than the direct install option, NYSEG and RG&amp;E are directed to develop BYOT options for their respective DLC programs effective for the summer of 2016, for inclusion with their summer 2016 DLM program changes to be filed on or before January 7, 2016.</p><p>Third, most of the utilities proposed 21-day deadlines  for the installation of interval   metering,  following customer  payment, when that metering  is needed participate in the DLRP and CSRP programs. Utilities that miss this deadline  must make lost reservation  payments to affected customers  who are unable to participate in DLM programs because of a delay in installing an interval  meter. Instead of 21 days, Central Hudson proposed a 30-day installation deadline,  whereas Niagara Mohawk did not propose any interval  meter installation deadline,  nor did they propose to make any lost reservation  payments<page number="26" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> to affected customers.  In order to maintain uniformity of tariff  provisions related to the important topic of interval   metering,  Central Hudson and Niagara Mohawk are directed to adopt tariff  language specifying a 21-day deadline  and providing for lost reservation  payments funded by shareholders to customers  who are precluded from participating because the utility missed its deadline. </p><p>Fourth, while AEMA correctly contends that Con Edison's 96% threshold for calling a CSRP demand response event is optimal, there may be strong reasons for the utilities to propose different thresholds. Therefore we direct O&amp;R, Central Hudson, and Niagara Mohawk to consider whether their program would benefit from conforming to the 96% threshold, and evaluate use of the threshold in their annual reports for their respective programs.</p><p>Fifth, as NRG states, each of the utilities should use a standardized method for measurement and verification (M&amp;V). Therefore, the utilities are directed to adopt the customer  baseline (CBL) operating procedures currently in place at Con Edison, and to post such procedures on their respective websites, for the purposes of establishing a consistent and uniform M&amp;V methodology. <page number="27" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> Finally, we direct the utilities to post day-ahead and summer peak  forecast information to their respective websites for the use of DLM participants and aggregators  in anticipating DLM program events.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">DLM Program Costs</emphasis></p><p>The estimated cost of the DLM programs for 2015, as proposed by the utilities, is approximately $ 4.0 million in total among all of the utilities. Central Hudson estimates that its programs will cost approximately $ 2.0 million, in part due to its service territory-wide implementation of its DLC program. NYSEG estimates that its DLM programs will cost approximately $ 280,000; Niagara Mohawk's estimate is approximately $ 520,000; RG&amp;E's estimate is approximately $ 170,000; and, O&amp;R's estimate is approximately $ 940,000. Actual costs of the utilities' DLM programs will vary due to the modifications we have required in this order and the actual participation and performance rates in the DLM programs.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">CONCLUSION</emphasis></h><p>Implementing DLM programs in each utility service territory  represents a major step forward toward meeting energy,  capacity, and reliability  goals in a cost effective and environmentally friendly way. It is anticipated that the utilities' DLM programs <page number="28" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> will continue to evolve and improve in the coming years. Furthermore, as envisioned in the REV Proceeding, DLM programs will eventually become commonplace features of the utility business model in New York as the utilities incorporate demand response into their everyday operations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">The Commission orders:</emphasis></p><p>1.

Immediate events last for six hours and do not require reservation  payment option participants to respond, however participants are encouraged to provide load  relief as soon as they are able. Reservation  payments will be made to customers  who elect to enroll  in the Reservation  Payment Option of $ 2.75 per kW per month. The Reservation  Payment shall be calculated  equal to the applicable reservation  payment rate multiplied  by the kW of contracted   load  relief, multiplied  by the Performance Factor. The performance factor is generally calculated  to be equal to the average amount of kW load  relief actually supplied during an event divided by the kW of contracted   load  relief. Performance payments will be made to reservation  option participants of $ 0.15 for each kWh that is reduced during the first four hours of an event. In addition participating customers  will receive a bonus payment of $ 0.30 for each kWh starting in the fifth hour of consecutive load  relief during an event.

AEMA's four general proposed improvements were: (1) increase customer  engagement and provide every customer  in each utility's service territory  the opportunity to participate in the DLM programs by creating peak  shaving and local distribution reliability  programs available<page number="73" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> across the entire utility service territory,  allowing customers  to participate in both wholesale and distribution-level demand response programs, and allowing any customer  to who meets program requirements to participate in any DLM program; (2) use the criteria from Con Edison's DLRP for dispatching local distribution reliability  program events, to ensure that emergency  generators are able participate in these events while maintaining compliance with the regulations established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); (3) establish a more transparent process for developing incentive payment structures; and (4) shorten the normal month-ahead application deadline  for DLM programs for the summer of 2015 to allow DLM programs to begin on July 1.</p><p>AEMA offered three recommendations regarding Niagara Mohawk's proposed DLM programs: (1) expand the DLRP and PSLR to be available service territory-wide; (2) align DLRP event criteria with Con Edison's criteria; and (3) permit participation from all customers  who meet program requirements. First, AEMA urged the Commission to direct Niagara Mohawk to expand its DLRP and PSLR program across its entire service territory  for the<page number="74" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> summer of 2015, stating that distribution-level demand response programs can be used for other purposes than only relieving isolated distribution constraints, and that Niagara Mohawk will lose out on a number of other benefits of distribution-level demand response if these programs are not expanded. AEMA cites a number reasons to expand demand response: (1) similar programs in Con Edison's service territory  and Pennsylvania have been shown to be cost effective; (2) additional participation in peak  capacity-reducing demand response can reduce capacity prices, provide a stable pricing signal and encourage additional participation, and put New York in a better position to comply with EPA air pollution regulations; (3) the program will reduce wear and tear on existing transmission and distribution infrastructure, deferring infrastructure costs; and (4) territory-wide roll out will increase customer  engagement and satisfaction with their utility. Second, AEMA expresses concern that the dispatch criteria proposed by Niagara Mohawk may not conform to those required to ensure that emergency  generation assets may operate during DLRP events. AEMA recommends that Niagara Mohawk mirror the Con<page number="75" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> Edison DLRP dispatch criteria, or otherwise adopt language proposed by AEMA. Third, AEMA expresses concern that the Niagara Mohawk DLM programs appear to exclude participation by customers  with demand between 100 kW and 250 kW. AEMA proposes that such customers  should be allowed to participate in Niagara Mohawk's DLM programs provided that they incur the necessary interval  meter installation and communications costs.</p><p>AEMA offers three recommendations regarding Central Hudson's proposed DLM programs: (1) AEMA urges Central Hudson to allow dual participation in both its demand response programs and the NYISO Special Case Resources (SCR) program, (2) that Central Hudson should explain why it selected the 94% of forecast summer peak   load  threshold for its CSRP instead of the 96% of summer peak   load  threshold in place in Con Edison's CSRP, and (3) that Central Hudson should explain why it did not choose to pursue a local distribution reliability  program. First, AEMA cites a variety of reasons why dual participation in DLM programs and the NYISO's SCR program is reasonable. AEMA notes that the NYISO SCR program and utility DLM programs have different purposes and value streams which are<page number="76" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> incremental to each other, and that forcing customers  to choose whether to participate in either the SCR or utility DLM programs will likely result in customers  choosing the SCR program due to its higher payments. AEMA argues that if customers  only participate in the SCR program then the DLM programs will achieve none of the anticipated benefits. Furthermore, AEMA argues that the SCR program is generally dispatched less frequently than the utility DLM programs would be, resulting in few hours of valuable utility peak   load  relief and incurring significant costs that could have been avoided if participation in both programs were allowed.</p><p>AEMA offers three recommendations regarding NYSEG and RG&amp;E's proposed DLM programs: (1) NYSEG and RG&amp;E should clarify whether customers  throughout their service territories  are eligible to enroll  in their respective DLRP and CSRP programs, and if such programs are limited to certain areas then the Commission should order NYSEG and RG&amp;E to expand these programs across the entire service territories;  (2) that NYSEG and RG&amp;E align their respective DLRP event criteria with Con Edison's criteria to ensure that emergency  generators are eligible to provide<page number="77" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/>  load  relief under these programs; and (3) that NYSEG and RG&amp;E should allow customers  on mandatory hourly  pricing or voluntary hourly  pricing to participate in their respective DLM programs, or at a minimum such customers  should be allowed to choose to switch between hourly  pricing and participation in the DLM programs.</p><p>AEMA offers only one recommendation regarding O&amp;R's proposed DLM programs: that O&amp;R explain why it selected its 94% of forecast summer peak   load  as the threshold for calling CSRP events. AEMA argues that the 96% threshold used by Con Edison and other demand response programs in Pennsylvania is a more appropriate threshold since it would ensure that the cost-effectiveness of the CSRP is maximized by only calling the program during the highest periods of summer demand and minimizing customer  participation fatigue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">NRG Energy,  Inc.</emphasis></p><p>The comments submitted by NRG Energy  Inc. (NRG) were generally supportive of the Commission's Order to structure the various utility DLM filings off of the example of those already in place at Con Edison. NRG offered a number of specific comments broadly falling into three categories: (1) the draft tariffs  should be revised to achieve maximum<page number="78" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> program eligibility and participation, (2) the state-wide DLM tariffs  should achieve program uniformity, and (3) DLM program payment structures and benefit cost analysis.</p><p>NRG advances two positions to argue that the draft tariffs  should be revised to achieve maximum program eligibility and participation: (1) DLM programs should be available to the broadest geographic region possible, and (2) that DLM program participants should not be precluded from participating in both the New York Independent System Operator's (NYISO) Special Case Resources (SCR) program. First, NRG notes that the DLM programs proposed by Niagara Mohawk are restricted to a small area of its service territory,  with additional areas to be added after the summer of 2015. NRG states that Niagara Mohawk's proposal loses significant benefits such as increased system efficiency and improved system reliability  and resiliency, and requests that the Commission direct Niagara Mohawk to expand its DLM programs across its full service territory  or explain why additional Company Designated  Areas have not been identified. NRG also argues that the draft tariffs  submitted by NYSEG and RG&amp;E also limit the availability of certain<page number="79" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> programs to Company Designated  Areas without sufficiently defining such areas in their draft tariffs,  and requests that the Commission direct NYSEG and RG&amp;E to clarify whether customers  throughout their entire service territory  are eligible to enroll  in those proposed programs. NRG requests that, to the extent that these DLM programs are limited in scope, the utilities should demonstrate why such programs should not be expanded across the companies' full service territories.  NRG also requests that, to the extent that the scope of the proposed DLM programs has been limited for the purposes of implementation during the summer of 2015, the utilities should be required to demonstrate how DLM programs will be expanded over time. Second, NRG argues that DLM program participants should also be allowed to participate in the NYISO's SCR program because the products and services offered at wholesale and distribution levels are designated  for different purposes. NRG requests that the Commission direct Central Hudson to allow its DLM program participants to also participate in the NYISO SCR program as well.</p><p>NRG argues that the draft tariffs  do not go far enough in standardizing certain program<page number="80" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> features. Specifically, NRG states that, while each of the draft tariffs  incorporate similar language adopting the Customer  Baseline Load  (CBL) methodology for measurement and verification of load   relief provided  during demand response events, the draft tariffs  lack detail about each utility's operating procedures for using the CBL methodology. NRG requests that the Commission require that utility baseline operating procedures be as consistent as possible across utilities and DLM programs. NRG further requests that the Commission require the utilities to expand and revise their respective DLM programs as uniformly as possible in future annual filings to the Commission.</p><p>NRG argues that the Commission should take into account the avoided wholesale market costs which will be achieved by the various DLM programs. NRG also states that it is unclear from the draft tariffs  how the utilities supported their incentive payment structures and which methodology was used to arrive at incentive payments. NRG requests that the utilities be required to justify the payment structures proposed in their draft DLM program tariffs. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Comverge, Inc.</emphasis></p><p>The comments submitted by Comverge, Inc. (Comverge) <page number="81" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> were focused on the Direct Load  Control programs and can be generally be placed into two categories: (1) discussion of the value of demand response as a resource, and (2) identifying specific shortcomings and improvements which could be made to the utilities' proposed DLC programs. First, Comverge urges the Commission to consider the value of demand response as a function of five characteristics: (1) how predictably a resource provide load  relief, (2) how reliable a resource is to respond when called upon, (3) how quickly a resource can respond when called upon, (4) how long a resource can sustain a steady amount of load  relief, and (5) how much capacity a resource can provide. Comverge states that those resources which perform strongly in all five categories are more useful to system operators than those whose performance is worse, and that the Commission should consider tariff  designs which incentivize high performance in those categories. Comverge notes that there can be substantial differences in performance characteristics of control devices used for residential DLC programs, especially among central air conditioners, and that incentivizing customers  to install and use high-value<page number="82" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> devices is particularly important in these programs. Comverge also notes the value of two-way data exchange between control devices and the system operator to increase visibility into the operation of the control devices, ensuring anticipated levels of program participation, and more accurate payment settlement with customers  for performance during demand response events.</p><p>Comverge goes on to identify four shortcomings of the tariffs  proposed by the utilities. First, Comverge states that the utilities draft tariff  leaves do not recognize any difference in device characteristics in the incentive payments made to participants using disparate devices. Second, Comverge notes the tariffs  fail to sufficiently discourage mid-event opt-outs by program participants since customers  are paid the participation incentive based on the fraction of number of total event hours during the course of the capability  period. Third, Comverge argues that the all-or-nothing nature of the annual participation payment creates perverse incentives for opting-out of further events for customers  who know that they have either met the minimum requirements already or those who know that they cannot reach the minimum<page number="83" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> requirement at all. Finally, Comverge states that the draft tariffs  fail to recognize that the benefits of demand response capacity will vary by location.</p><p>Finally, Comverge proposes a number of modifications that it believes will address the problems with the draft tariffs  which it identified. First, Comverge proposes that tiers of control devices be developed based on the five characteristics identified and performance levels. Comverge suggests that different incentive levels could be paid to participants depending upon the tier of device they install. Comverge further suggests that the utilities should maintain a list of approved devices and their applicable tiers on their websites. Second, Comverge proposes to structure participation payments made to customers  based on the number of events in which a customer  fully participated throughout the entire event. Comverge notes that the utilities could develop a per-event payment rate equal to the utilities' proposed annual participation payment divided by the number of forecast DLC events called per year. Third, Comverge proposes that the utilities should include an option to provide additional financial incentives to spur participation<page number="84" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> in areas of distribution relief need. Finally, Comverge proposes that, if sufficient metering  infrastructure is in place in the future, the Commission should consider linking incentive payments to actual kWh load   reductions  at individual premises during called events. Comverge states that the revisions it proposes to the utilities' tariffs  would yield a more operationally valuable demand response resource by discouraging mid-event opt-outs and incentivizing control device  installations in areas where they are most valuable to the system. Comverge states that its proposal to vary the incentive level based on performance and characteristics of the control devices incentivizes customers  to select higher-value control devices, while the tiered incentive payment system ensures that the values of these devices are easy for customers  to understand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">New York Battery and Energy  Storage Technology Consortium, Inc.</emphasis></p><p>The comments submitted by the New York Battery and Energy  Technology Consortium, Inc. (NYBEST), were generally supportive of the Commission's goals in instituting the DLM tariffs.  NYBEST agrees with the Commission that distribution-level demand response programs provide a number<page number="85" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> of system and public policy benefits. NYBEST cautions that the DLM tariffs  should include energy  storage and other new technologies as eligible resources with incentives that are appropriate for the quality and certainty of dispatch, and that the Commission should expand the scope of the DLM program tariffs  to include both behind-the-meter and in-front-of-the-meter technologies as eligible for incentives or other changes to fully value participating resources. NYBEST goes on to extoll the benefits of energy  storage, but states that there are a number of hurdles which must be overcome: (1) current market design precludes energy  storage from providing multiple benefits from the same storage device; (2) maximizing benefits of energy  storage requires complex planning, operations, and modeling to optimize multiple competing value streams; and (3) it is exceedingly difficult to obtain location-specific data to help develop energy  storage where it is most beneficial.</p><p>NYBEST proposes an Asset Utilization Tariff  in the short term to focus on peak   reduction  in congested areas and improving system utilization through demand response. As its reasoning for why a new type of tariff  is necessary, <page number="86" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> NYBEST states that it is concerned that the tariffs  proposed by the Utilities are too limited to achieve the transformational changes envisioned in the REV proceeding. NYBEST states that tariffs  established to achieve REV goals should: (1) be standardized across utilities and technologies, (2) unbundle costs to end users to allow multiple benefit streams to energy  storage and other technologies, (3) provide for locational and temporal granularity, (4) allow flexibility to respond to market and load  conditions, (5) address current tariff  structures which hinder deployment of Distributed Energy  Resources (DER), and (6) provide medium to long-term visibility to tariffs  that would allow DERs to sign long-term contracts. NYBEST argues that utilities should include cost-effective incentives for energy  storage and other technologies through its proposed Asset Utilization Tariff  framework. NYBEST proposes that such a tariff  should be technology neutral, designed to improve grid utilization rates, and be based on cost savings to each utility from reduced wholesale market capacity obligations, T&amp;D infrastructure deferral, distribution system peak   load  management, and energy  savings. NYBEST <page number="87" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 276"/> further states that its proposed Asset Utilization Tariff  could be structured similarly to the current demand management tariff  in place at Con Edison.</p><p>NYBEST continues by communicating the need for more system data from the utilities in order to best develop energy  storage and other DER, and recommends as a near term action that all utilities should map the grid at all levels to identify areas of congestion and areas of DER development opportunities. NYBEST further extolls the need for sub-hourly usage data to be provided for the use of DER developers, and suggests that the Commission should require that aggregated smart meter and power quality data be made available to DER providers.</p></bodyText></decisionOpinion></opinions></administrativeDecision></administrativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5G91-R3F0-00T9-708J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">139837</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2015-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><paginationScheme pageScheme="2015 N.Y.
