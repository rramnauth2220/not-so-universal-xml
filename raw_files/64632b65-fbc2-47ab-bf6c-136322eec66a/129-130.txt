Although Commission Rule 3.9(d) is intended to create the conditions<page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> necessary for such a free exchange of views by requiring parties to maintain the confidentiality of settlement  discussions, the rule is inadequate in this case, Staff  contends, because it is only designed to prevent public disclosure of sensitive information.  The risk here, Staff  says, is not that FES, Entergy, and NRG will release such information to outside parties, but rather that they will use it in developing their own competitive  strategies. Party status, Staff  argues, should not be a vehicle for obtaining an unfair commercial advantage. <footnote><anchor id="fnote6_14_200_82"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Ibid</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>In support of its position, Staff  points to a 2010 ruling in an Orange and Rockland Utilities rate case in which the judges rejected the requests for party status of three investor-owned utilities, RG&amp;E, New York State Electric  and Gas Corporation (NYSEG), and Central Hudson Gas and Electric  Corporation (CHGE). <footnote><anchor id="fnote7_16_218_171"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p> Case 10-E-0362, <emphasis typeStyle="un">Orange and Rockland Utilities - Electric  Rates</emphasis>, Ruling on Schedule and Other Procedural Matters (issued October 5, 2010) (O&amp;R Ruling).</p></bodyText></footnote> In that case, the judges found that the utilities had only expressed an interest in monitoring the proceeding, something that could be accomplished<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> without party status. They had failed to demonstrate that they intended to contribute to the record, and had described no direct interest in the proceeding that would justify the conclusion that their intervention would otherwise be fair and in the public interest. Staff  contends that the same conclusions could be reached about FES, Entergy, and NRG in this case.</p><p>Finally, Staff  requests that if its motion to exclude FES, Entergy, and NRG is denied, we should clarify  that party status does not automatically   entitle  these companies to participate in settlement   negotiations.  Citing the O&amp;R Ruling, it notes that the Commission rule governing such negotiations,   <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="16 NY ADMIN 3.9"><content><span normalizedCite="16 N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. ยง 3.9">16 NYCRR 3.9<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#9878#571#00000016#00000003#00000009#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>, requires that invitations be extended only to "appropriate parties."</p><p>Responses to Staff's  motion were filed by Multiple Intervenors (MI), Alliance for <page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> a Green Economy and Citizens Environmental Coalition (AGREE/CEC), Entergy, NRG, the Utility Intervention Unit of the Department of State (UIU), and Ginna. Ginna supports Staff's  motion, but only as to FES; the other respondents oppose  it. RG&amp;E did not respond to Staff's  motion.</p><p>Ginna's letter in support of Staff's  motion contends that there is no basis for FES to intervene  because FES has no business interests in New York and its "purported issues" are before FERC, not the Commission. Therefore, Ginna argues, there is no basis for finding that FES's participation is likely to contribute to the record or otherwise be fair and in the public interest.  Furthermore, Ginna asserts, "the ALJs must ensure that competitors  in unrelated markets, like FES โฆ not be allowed to advance their business interests in a way that threatens the orderly conduct or integrity of a proceeding." Competitors  should not be permitted to misuse a proceeding to obtain non-public competitive  information, to impose undue burdens on parties with legitimate interests in the proceeding, to hinder settlement  or to otherwise threaten the integrity of this proceeding.</p><p>MI argues, first, that Staff's  motion is untimely. <page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> It comes three weeks after the Ginna motion we ruled untimely  in the FES Ruling, but does not even address the timeliness issue. Second, MI suggests, Staff  should be considered to have waived its right to challenge the party status of FES, Entergy, and NRG because it failed to respond to Ginna's motion to revoke  the party status of FES. Third, MI says, Staff  offered no valid reason for excluding FES, Entergy and NRG. Not only is there no rule barring competitors  from participating  in Commission proceedings, but, in fact, such participation is warranted because such entities  have a direct interest in ensuring that payments under the RSSA are not excessive and the term of the RSSA is no longer than necessary. Fourth, MI contends, Staff's  justification for excluding these entities  on competitive  grounds is questionable. Ginna has decided either to operate under a regulated contract as a market "price taker," or to abandon the business and retire. Its competitive  interests do not appear to be threatened by the participation of FES, Entergy, and NRG. Finally, MI says that no issue has yet arisen, to its knowledge, where the party status of these entities  has proven detrimental to the record, <page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> and Staff  has failed to substantiate its concern that this might occur in the future.</p><p>FES notes that it has participated actively  in the proceeding and has promulgated several information requests seeking information relevant and material to this case. This, it says, shows its ability and desire to contribute to the record. Staff's  Motion, FES argues, is based entirely on speculation, is unjustified, would lead to an unjust and unreasonable result, and is contrary to the Commission's settlement  rules. It notes that its representatives have signed not only the Protective Order  we issued in this case, but also an Addendum  to the Protective Order  that was circulated by Ginna for the purpose of providing "additional restrictions on the use and dissemination of confidential information  when the requesting party is a competitor  of Exelon (the parent of Ginna)." <footnote><anchor id="fnote8_22_387_72"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p> A copy of the Addendum  was filed by FES as an attachment to its response.</p></bodyText></footnote>FES states that no one, including Staff,  asserts that FES has violated the terms of these documents. Thus, FES asserts, Staff  has no basis to be concerned on Ginna's behalf or on behalf of RG&amp;E. Furthermore, as to contentions that it might abuse its party status and "threaten the integrity" of the proceeding, FES notes that the<page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> presiding ALJs have sufficient authority to prevent any party from interfering with the orderly conduct of the case. Finally, FES urges rejection of Staff's  requested clarification of entitlement to participation in settlement negotiations,  saying that the requirement that all appropriate parties be notified combined with the obligation of the ALJs to "protect the rights of persons participating  or desiring to participate," <footnote><anchor id="fnote9_22_408_89"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p><citation type="statute" normalizedCite="16 NY ADMIN 3.9"><content><span normalizedCite="16 N.Y.

It is also actively  involved in the Reforming the Energy  Vision proceeding that is investigating non-traditional solutions to reliability  problems caused by retirement of central generation<page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> facilities such as Ginna's. Thus, NRG argues, it is affected by any decision allocating costs between retail customers, impacting wholesale  markets, or affecting solutions to reliability  problems, which are all issues in this proceeding. Furthermore, NRG says, its status as a developer of wholesale   energy  resources makes it uniquely capable of contributing to the record concerning solutions to reliability  needs in the Rochester area, and the duration, extent and economic impact of the proposed RSSA. Staff's  Motion, NRG asserts, seeks the extreme remedy of depriving the company of its party status based on an unsubstantiated allegation that its participation might inhibit  development of the record. The ALJs, it says, are fully capable and authorized to determine whether the process is being hindered and to fashion appropriate remedies. Moreover, NRG argues, Staff  did not explain why this case is so different from other proceedings in which diverse stakeholders and potential and actual competitors  have participated  without objection and where such participation has enhanced the record, including in settlement  proceedings. It notes that attorneys for NRG, Entergy, and Ginna's parent <page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> company, Exelon, have already worked out procedures in this case for the disclosure and handling of sensitive confidential information  without the need for intervention by the ALJs.</p><p>UIU opposes   Staff's  motion because, in its view, the active participation  of these competing generators  contributes to the record. According to UIU, these parties have submitted well-considered and highly relevant information requests and possess technical market and operational expertise that will inform the analysis of information in this proceeding. UIU distinguishes the O&amp;R Ruling because here, the interests of Entergy and NRG are not generic but instead specific and immediately apparent. UIU asserts that both Entergy and NRG participate in the New York energy  markets and both could be directly affected by the RSSA. UIU also says FES would be indirectly affected because it participates in a neighboring energy  market that "regularly interacts" with the New York markets. Finally, UIU asserts that Staff's  concerns cannot be abated by unilateral action at the State level given the parallel Federal review before FERC. Therefore, UIU asks that, if Staff's  motion is granted, the ruling be held in abeyance <page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> until FERC also revokes  the party status of these entities. </p><p>Entergy argues Staff's  motion is untimely  inasmuch as Entergy has actively   participated  since August 2014 without any opposition or objection from any party. Entergy says Staff  offered no justification for its delay and has not discussed why the FES Ruling should not require denial of its motion. Invoking notions of fundamental fairness, Entergy says Staff  sat silent for nine months while Entergy devoted significant time and effort to participate in this case. Entergy describes its active participation  thus far and claims it has significantly contributed to the record. It notes that other parties have already relied on evidence adduced by Entergy during discovery  to support their positions. Entergy also asserts that the specific concerns it has focused on (i.e., whether the RSSA adequately accommodated alternatives, the potential use of operational protocols as an alternative to the RSSA, and the need for reporting requirements to ensure timely implementation of alternatives) cannot be adequately represented by any other party. This is because no other party, Entergy argues, has first-hand knowledge of the NYISO procedures<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> as applied to nuclear facilities. Entergy also cites to its experience working with the NYISO on managing outage requests, and claims its system experience will be "particularly critical" to implementing timely alternatives, which, it asserts, is a key issue in this case. It asserts there is no evidence that Entergy has delayed or interfered with this proceeding, and that, even if there were a basis for such concerns, it could be addressed by refining the Protective Order. </p><p>AGREE and CEC also oppose   Staff's  motion, saying that the discovery  requests of FES, Entergy and NRG have enlightened all the parties to critical information. They argue that Staff's  concern that Ginna may be reticent to openly discuss information in front of competitors  is not a compelling reason to revoke  the party state of entities  that are actively   participating.  AGREE and CEC argue that Ginna has relinquished its status as a competitive  merchant generator  by seeking out-of-market rates under the RSSA. They assert that Ginna should not be allowed or expected to withhold information to protect its ability to compete in the market, since it no longer seeks to do so. Moreover, to the extent Ginna continues to act<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> like a competitive  company, it reveals that it may not be serious about closing the plant in the absence of an RSSA. Ginna, they argue, "should not be allowed to have it both ways." AGREE and CEC also argue that revoking party status is overly aggressive and potentially damaging to the record, and urge other solutions if Ginna and RG&amp;E actually adopt the posture described by Staff's  concerns.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="un">DISCUSSION</emphasis></h><p>In our FES Ruling, we said:<excerpt><bodyText><p>The Commission's rules do not prescribe a specific time within which an objection to a conditional grant of party status must be lodged. The objective of ensuring fairness to all participants in Commission proceedings, however, surely requires that parties not be continuously subject to the threat of a motion for revocation of their status if they do something, otherwise wholly permissible, that irritates another party. In this case, no one raised any objection to FES's party status for two and a half months. That delay, in itself, is grounds for denying the motion, in our view. <footnote><anchor id="fnote10_30_607_589"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p>FES Ruling, p. 4.</p></bodyText></footnote></p></bodyText></excerpt>Staff's  current motion is even further delayed. FES filed its request for party status three and a half months ago; NRG eight months ago; and Entergy nine months <page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> ago. Despite the fact that the business interests of these entities  were never disguised and should have been obvious to everyone involved in this proceeding, no effort was made by anyone to challenge their party status until Ginna's motion last month aimed at FES, followed now by Staff's  motion adding Entergy and NRG. In the meantime, these companies have filed comments, engaged in discovery,   participated  in a procedural conference, and filed statements of issues for hearing. They have, in fact, submitted to the terms of a protective order  and received confidential information  from other parties, including Ginna.</p><p>The only justification for such a long delay in filing a motion to remove a party that we can think of would be recent conduct by the party that could be considered an abuse of its party status. If such abuse demonstrably occurs in the future, a motion such as this would likely be in order. For now, however, while Staff  argues in general terms that an entity  should not be allowed to <page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> use party status as a means of gaining a competitive  advantage, it makes no specific allegation of such behavior by any of the entities  targeted in its motion. <footnote><anchor id="fnote11_33_654_230"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p> We recognize that Staff's  concerns about the potential adverse impacts on settlement  negotiations  were necessarily speculative since Staff's  motion was made before the parties' first settlement  conference.</p></bodyText></footnote> Furthermore, we have not received any complaint of such behavior from anyone else. Had we, we would have been able to take appropriate action to curb it, and we stand ready to do so if the need arises.</p><p>Because we find the delay in filing this request to revoke  party status to be unjustified, we deny Staff's  motion. We note, however, that if we were to address the motion on its merits, the decision would be no different. Rule 4.3(c)(1) states that anyone may ask the presiding officer for permission to intervene,  and provides that permission "will be granted" if one of two tests is met: (a) the intervention is likely to contribute to the development <page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> of a complete record, or (b) intervention is otherwise fair and in the public interest.  In this case, FES, Entergy, and NRG have been active participants as described above. MI, UIU, and AGREE/CEC have all indicated that the discovery  efforts of these parties have been helpful in developing the factual record, with MI going so far as to offer to adopt FES's information requests as its own if FES were excluded from party status. Given the businesses in which FES, Entergy, and NRG are engaged, we could very readily have concluded that they brought expertise to the case that made it likely that their participation as parties would contribute to the record, but their actions make it unnecessary for us to make such a prediction. They have already contributed to the record, and we have been given no reason to believe that they will not continue to do so. Their intervention under Rule 4.3(c)(1) is appropriate.</p><p>We next consider Staff's  request that we clarify  that party status does not automatically   entitle  an entity  to participate in settlement   negotiations.  We so clarify.  We believe this is a reasonable interpretation of the "appropriate parties" language of Commission Rule 3.9, as the judges<page number="17" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> concluded in the O&amp;R Ruling. Under Rule 3.9, the presiding judges are required to report to the Commission that all appropriate parties have been given an opportunity to participate. We or the Commission, therefore, have the authority to determine if a party is to be deemed inappropriate for participation in settlement  discussions.</p><p>As yet, no concrete example of the inhibition of settlement   negotiations  due to the presence of FES, Entergy, or NRG has been presented to us. Furthermore, we understand from the responses received that FES, Entergy, and NRG have all, without our involvement,  worked out arrangements with Ginna to allow for the sharing of competitively sensitive information.  These arrangements include use of an addendum  to the protective order  we issued, and an agreement to modify the rights of the receiving party under that protective order.  Apparently, heretofore, these arrangements have been sufficient to alleviate Ginna's concerns about providing competitively sensitive information  to competitors.  This would seem to significantly alleviate Staff's  concerns that sharing such information will seriously inhibit   settlement  talks.</p><p>While we see no need to intervene  at this<page number="18" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. PUC LEXIS 258"/> time concerning the involvement  of FES, Entergy, and NRG in this case, we remind the parties that if settlement  discussions are actually stifled by information disclosure concerns, we remain willing and available to hear those concerns and to devise appropriate procedures to protect legitimate competitive  interests from undue compromise. In addition, if such discussions resume, the parties may wish to consider requesting the appointment of a settlement  judge who can monitor negotiations  and be readily available to mediate concerns as they arise.</p><p>SEAN MULLANY</p><p>DAVID PRESTEMON</p></bodyText></decisionOpinion></opinions></administrativeDecision></administrativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5G50-WTH0-00T9-706G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">139837</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2015-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><paginationScheme pageScheme="2015 N.Y.
