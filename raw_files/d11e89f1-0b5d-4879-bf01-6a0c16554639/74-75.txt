McCulley, an administrative enforcement proceeding. The decision and order ("2009 Order") addressed the alleged violation by respondent James W. McCulley of section 196.1 of title 6 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York ("6 NYCRR"), arising from his operation of a motor vehicle within the State forest preserve  <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_8_61_169"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> Section 196.1(a) of 6 NYCRR provides that "(n)o person shall operate a motorized  vehicle in the forest preserve"  except in limited circumstances. The exceptions at issue in this proceeding involved 6 NYCRR 196.1(b)(1) where operation of motorized  vehicles is permitted on roads that are under the jurisdiction of a town highway  department, and 6 NYCRR 196.1(b)(5) where operation of motorized  vehicles is permitted where a legal right-of-way  exists for public or private use.</p></bodyText></footnote> on a portion of Old Mountain Road <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_8_61_166"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> Old Mountain Road is also known as Old Military Road, as well as other name designations. I will refer to it as Old Mountain Road in this Decision and Ruling.</p></bodyText></footnote> in the Town of North Elba. The hearing report recommended that the Commissioner grant respondent's motion to dismiss Department staff's  complaint and the 2009 Order adopted that recommendation.</p><p><page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/></p><p>By papers dated June 5, 2009, Department staff  moved for clarification  of various portions of the 2009 Order. Department staff  expressly stated that it was not seeking a reversal of the dismissal of the action against respondent McCulley. The Adirondack Council and the Adirondack Park Agency ("APA"), by papers dated June 29, 2009 and July 9, 2009, respectively, petitioned to intervene with respect to staff's  motion. By letter dated July 2, 2009, respondent McCulley opposed Department staff's  motion, and by letters dated July 10, 2009 respondent opposed or otherwise objected  to the Adirondack Council's and the APA's requests to intervene.</p><p>By motion dated September 9, 2009, respondent requested that: (1) the petitions of the APA and Adirondack Council be stricken; (2) then-Commissioner Alexander B. Grannis be recused as decision maker; and (3) all ex parte communications involving the Commissioner, Chief Administrative Law  Judge James T. McClymonds, DEC Staff,  APA, and the Adirondack Council be disclosed immediately. <page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> On September 17, 2009, respondent supplemented its motion, presenting further argument regarding alleged ex parte communications.</p><p>Following receipt of further submissions, then-Acting Commissioner Peter M. Iwanowicz, in a ruling dated December 30, 2010 ("2010 Ruling"), granted Department staff's  motion for clarification  on the following issues:</p><p>(1) the obligations of the Towns of North Elba and Keene to improve and maintain Old Mountain Road;</p><p>(2) whether ATV and snowmobile  use of highways  is lawful where a town has not opened a highway; </p><p>(3) the criteria for statutory abandonment  of a highway; </p><p>(4) the extent to which hiking, snowshoeing,  skiing,  and similar recreational  uses promoted by the Department pursuant to the Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan and/or Unit Management Plans are indications of travel  or use as a highway  under the New York Highway Law;  and</p><p>(5) the legal implications of dismissing the case either as a matter of law  or as a failure to meet  the burden of proof. </p><p>(2010 Ruling at 3-4). The Acting Commissioner also granted APA's motion and, in part, the motion of the Adirondack Council to intervene in the proceeding (id. at 2), and denied respondent's<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> motion (id. at 2, 5-10). As stated by the Acting Commissioner, the granting of Department staff's  motion for clarification  "does not in any way affect the dismissal of the enforcement action  against respondent" (id. at 2). The Acting Commissioner set a schedule for the submission of briefs on the five (5) issues identified for clarification  (id. at 10-11). <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_19_197_19"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> Respondent McCulley, in a letter dated January 19, 2011, requested an inquiry to confirm that former Acting Commissioner Peter M. Iwanowicz signed the 2010 Ruling while he still held the position of Acting Commissioner. Chief Administrative Law  Judge ("Chief ALJ") James T. McClymonds certified, via letter dated January 24, 2011, that the former Acting Commissioner did in fact sign the 2010 Ruling on December 30, 2010. By letter dated March 16, 2011, respondent rejected the Chief ALJ's certification and requested an affidavit from former Acting Commissioner Iwanowicz stating that he signed the 2010 Ruling on December 30, 2010. Respondent's request was then forwarded to Assistant Commissioner for Hearings and Mediation Services, Louis A. Alexander. After reviewing respondent's inquiry, Assistant Commissioner Alexander determined that the Chief ALJ's certification was sufficient proof that the former Acting Commissioner signed the 2010 Ruling, and further stated that the Acting Commissioner had given the Assistant Commissioner the 2010 Ruling, signed on December 30, 2010, on the morning of December 31, 2010 (see Asst. Commissioner Alexander Letter, April 7, 2011).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/><br/>In accordance with the schedule set by the Acting Commissioner, Department staff  submitted its brief addressing issues to be clarified on February 4, 2011 ("Staff  brief"). Reply  briefs were to be filed by Friday, March 11, 2011. Assistant Commissioner for Hearings and Mediation Services Louis A. Alexander later granted Adirondack Council's unopposed request to extend the date of submission for all reply  briefs to March 18, 2011, with a receipt time of "no later than 5:00 p.m."</p><p>APA, Adirondack Council and respondent all submitted reply  briefs dated March 18, 2011 ("APA reply, " "Adirondack Council reply, " and "McCulley reply, " respectively). In an email dated March 21, 2011, respondent McCulley formally objected  to the APA reply  as untimely because the emailed brief was submitted after 5:00 p.m. Friday, March 18, 2011, and also objected  to APA's reply  on the ground that it was not signed by an attorney or representative of the APA. In response, the APA submitted, by letter dated March 22, 2011, a signed final page of its reply  to correct "the inadvertent omission of the signature." APA further stated that its reply  was electronically transmitted to the Office of Hearings and Mediation<page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> Services and the parties over counsel's signature at 5:08 p.m. on March 18, 2011.</p><p>Respondent also objected  on March 22, 2011 to the Adirondack Council reply  because of a delay in its filing with the DEC Commissioner due to an electronic transmission failure. The Adirondack Council had provided an explanation of that failure, by letter dated March 21, 2011, and noted that all the other parties had timely received the Adirondack Council reply. </p><p>By letter dated April 5, 2011, Assistant Commissioner Alexander addressed respondent McCulley's objections. Although no specific signatory requirement exists, it is expected that parties sign papers submitted in any Department administrative proceeding  before the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services. Nevertheless, the Assistant Commissioner determined that because the transmittal letter accompanying the APA reply  was signed by counsel, the filing deficiency was remedied. He concluded that neither the initial failure to sign the APA reply  itself nor the short delay in the electronic transmission of the APA reply,  was prejudicial to respondent. He also concluded that the electronic transmission failure associated with the filing of the <page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> Adirondack Council reply  with the DEC Commissioner was not prejudicial to respondent. The Assistant Commissioner accepted the APA reply  and the Adirondack Council reply  into the record and I affirm his determination.</p><p>Respondent did not specifically address any of the issues Department staff  raised on its motion for clarification  and did not set forth any additional arguments. Respondent cited to his prior filings in the proceeding before the administrative law  judge ("ALJ") as well as the evidence, testimony and facts set forth in the evidentiary hearing held from November 13 to 15, 2007. Respondent argued that the 2009 Order is correct on the law and facts and "demands that the [2009] Order . . .remain unaltered and the motions for clarification  and reconsideration . . . be denied in their entirety" (McCulley reply  at 2-3).</p><p>The Assistant Commissioner provided the parties with the opportunity to submit sur-replies  and set a schedule for their submission (see Asst. Commissioner Letter, April 5, 2011). Department staff  submitted its sur-reply,  dated April 29, 2011 ("Staff  sur-reply" ). The APA, in an e-mail dated April 29, 2011, and the Adirondack Council, in a letter dated April <page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> 29, 2011, stated that they would not be submitting a sur-reply.  Respondent McCulley, in an e-mail dated April 29, 2011, stated that he would not submit a sur-reply  and continued his objection to the consideration of Department staff's  motion for clarification. </p><p>Department staff,  in its sur-reply,  argued that the 2009 Order must be clarified because of several discrepancies between it and the accompanying hearing report. Specifically, staff  reiterated its argument that the 2009 Order: (1) goes outside the hearing report's findings and recommendations by addressing the Town of Keene's and Town of North Elba's obligations regarding Old Mountain Road; (2) is ambiguous because it does not state whether Department staff's  case was dismissed as a matter of law  or for failure to meet  the burden of proof;  and (3) materially differs from the hearing report's analysis of New York Highway Law  § 205 (see Staff  sur-reply  at 2-3).</p><p>Staff  further states that the 2009 Order overlooked evidence that the public right-of-way  with respect to Old Mountain Road ceased to exist prior to 1986, and that the Master Plan supports the factual conclusion that Old Mountain Road was abandoned  prior to 1986 (see<page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> Staff  sur-reply  at 3-5). Subsequent recreational  use, staff  contends, did "not recreate the public right of way that was extinguished by abandonment  before the recreational  use resumed" (id. at 5).</p><p>As mentioned, Department staff  is not seeking to reinstate the charges against respondent McCulley and this Decision and Ruling does not affect the dismissal of the enforcement action  against him. After due consideration and, as discussed below, I am, however, vacating those portions of the 2009 Order that: (a) concluded that Old Mountain Road was a town road that had not been abandoned;  (b) concluded that Old Mountain Road is a legal right-of-way  for public use  pursuant to 6 NYCRR 196.1(b)(5); and (c) discussed and set forth obligations and responsibilities of the Towns of Keene and North Elba over Old Mountain Road. In addition, I am providing further clarification  of the 2009 Order regarding the significance of the filing of a certificate  of abandonment  by a town superintendent  and the basis for the dismissal of the complaint.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>A Commissioner has the inherent authority to clarify  a Commissioner decision where the Commissioner deems it necessary and to correct errors<page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

It provides for a master plan for management of state lands and individual unit management plans to guide the development and management of state lands in the Adirondack Park. The first Master Plan for management of State lands was approved by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in July 1972. Subsequent amendments to the Master Plan have been prepared by the APA, in consultation with the <page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> Department, and approved by the Governor after public hearing (see Executive Law § 816[2]). The Department, in consultation with APA, develops individual unit management plans for specific areas throughout the forest preserve  (see Executive Law § 816[1]). The Master Plan, which governs activities within the Adirondack forest preserve,  has been construed to have "the force of a legislative enactment" (<citation type="case" normalizedCite="90 Misc. 2d 583,at 604"><content>Helms v Reid, <span normalizedCite="90 Misc. 2d 583">90 Misc. 2d 583<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#235#3#000090#000583#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="90 Misc. 2d 583">604<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#235#3#000090#000583#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [Sup Ct Hamilton County 1977]; see also <citation type="case" normalizedCite="33 Misc. 3d 383,at 387"><content>Matter of Adirondack Mountain Club v Adirondack Park Agency, <span normalizedCite="33 Misc. 3d 383">33 Misc. 3d 383<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34044#3#000033#0000000383#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="33 Misc. 3d 383">387<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34044#3#000033#0000000383#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [Sup Ct Albany County 2011]).</p><p>Old Mountain Road is within the Sentinel Range in an area classified wilderness  in the Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan. The Master Plan submitted to the Governor in 1979 noted that Old Military Road (Old Mountain Road) was not generally passable by motorized  vehicles "but has not yet been appropriately barricaded as required by wilderness  guidelines" (1979 Master Plan at 46). However, the Master Plan that was approved in November 1987 stated, at page 51, that Old Military Road (Old Mountain Road), "a former town road 3.5 miles in length, has<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> been closed and the area now fully conforms to wilderness  standards " (emphasis added). The identical language appears in the Master Plan updated in 2001 (2001 Master Plan at 66). Public use of motor vehicles  (including ATVs and snowmobiles)  and motorized  equipment are prohibited in wilderness  areas, although recreational  uses such as skiing,  hiking, and snowshoeing  are permitted uses (see 2001 Master Plan at 23-24).</p><p>The Adirondack Council, in its papers, argues that the 2009 Order's conclusion that Old Mountain Road is an existing town road contradicts the Master Plan, which, the Adirondack Council argues, classifies the road as "abandoned  within the Forest Preserve"  (Adirondack Council reply  at 11). According to the Adirondack Council, allowing motor vehicles  to use Old Mountain Road "would violate the terms and provisions of the [Master Plan] and negatively impact the Forest Preserve"  (id. at 14).</p><p>APA contends that the Master Plan's determination that Old Mountain Road was closed by 1987 is a factual determination that is binding on the Department (see APA reply  at 7-8). The APA notes that the determinations of the Master Plan regarding Old Mountain Road were never contested<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> by the Towns of Keene or North Elba at the time of the Master Plan adoption in 1987 (which indicated that the road was closed and in full conformance with wilderness  standards), and that the text of the Master Plan was developed jointly by APA and the Department with formal public notice and hearings (see APA reply  at 5-9). APA notes further that the text of the 1987 Master Plan was subscribed to by the Department prior to its approval by the Governor (id. at 7). <footnote><anchor id="fnote5_38_554_154"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p> The APA argues that the Commissioner does not have jurisdiction to interpret the Master Plan, which states that Old Mountain Road is closed, in an administrative proceeding  before the Department in such a way as to contradict or reverse the Master Plan's findings (see APA reply  at 9-10). As noted in this Decision and Ruling, at the hearing Department staff  did not rely on the Master Plan as evidence of the abandonment  of Old Mountain Road and the Master Plan was not before the Commissioner as part of staff's  case. The 2009 Order did not and was not meant to interpret the Master Plan.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Even though the ALJ took official notice of the Master Plan in the 2007 administrative hearing, Department staff  did not offer<page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> the Master Plan into evidence, or otherwise rely upon Executive Law § 816 or the Master Plan in support of its argument that Old Mountain Road was abandoned  (see e.g. Staff  Attorney's Brief Opposing Respondent's Motion for Judgment during Trial dated February 25, 2008; Staff  Attorney's Closing Brief dated February 25, 2008).</p><p>For purposes of considering issues regarding road abandonment  in such proceedings, however, the Master Plan must be considered, and it was error to fail to proffer the Master Plan as evidence that Old Mountain Road was closed.</p><p>Moreover, Department staff,  in its brief addressing the issues for clarification,  has marshaled the evidence from the record in support of the argument that Old Mountain Road was abandoned  because of lack of use and physical obstructions from at least 1976 to 1986, and that the road ceased to exist by operation of Highway Law  § 205(1) prior to the time when the Adirondack Ski Touring Council undertook maintenance of portions of Old Mountain Road.</p><p>I have considered Staff's  arguments as well as the underlying record in the proceeding. Staff  states that any through travel  by the public in a normal manner that one would expect for a highway <page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> did not exist (see e.g. Staff  brief at 11-13). Staff  notes that the physical condition of Old Mountain Road indicates that it was not used for travel  in "forms reasonable and normal" (see id. at 14-15 [noting obstruction by beaver ponds, trees growing in the roadbed and other covering vegetation]; see also Adirondack Council reply,  at 8-9). Furthermore, the recreational  use by snowshoers, hikers, or skiers, through lands classified as wilderness  in the forest preserve  does not preclude a finding of abandonment  (see e.g. Staff  brief at 19-21; see also Adirondack reply  at 10-11). <footnote><anchor id="fnote6_43_655_14"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p> In that regard, based upon my review of the record of this proceeding, I do not agree that the findings of fact in the hearing report (see Hearing Report, at 8-10 [Findings of Fact 22-25]) demonstrate that the use of Old Mountain Road was of a nature that would preclude a finding of abandonment. </p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>On considering, among other things, the physical conditions that staff  cites with respect to Old Mountain Road and the types of recreational  uses that occurred, I find that the public was not using Old Mountain Road for highway  purposes. The record, as staff  recites, contains evidence that the road was<page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> obstructed for approximately ten years, more than the six years required for abandonment  to occur (see e.g. Staff  brief, at 25-26 [noting lack of maintenance, lack of a bridge for a period of about ten years, and beaver pond impacts], 27-28; see also Staff  sur-reply,  at 3-4). I concur with staff's  position that the road ceased to exist by operation of Highway Law  § 205. Accordingly, the hearing report's analysis regarding the Highway Law  and the related discussion on abandonment  that led to the conclusion that Old Mountain Road had not been abandoned  and that the road was a legal right-of-way  for public use  are rejected.</p><p>Based on consideration of the Master Plan which states that the road is closed and the record, I hereby find that Old Mountain Road is abandoned,  and it does not continue to exist as a public highway.  Accordingly, the conclusion in the 2009 Order that Old Mountain Road is an existing town road that has not been abandoned  and that the road is a legal right-of-way  for public use  is hereby vacated. </p><p>Notwithstanding the above holding, however, staff  does not seek, and I decline to order, reinstatement of the complaint against respondent. Accordingly, dismissal of the<page number="17" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> complaint as against respondent is not vacated. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Obligations of the Town of Keene and the Town of North Elba</emphasis></p><p>Department staff  also seeks to clarify  the obligations of the Town of Keene and the Town of North Elba to improve and maintain Old Mountain Road as referenced in the 2009 Order. The 2009 Order states that respondent successfully established "that both towns bear the responsibility to maintain [Old Mountain Road] in a way that will allow safe passage for the multitude of uses on it, including cross country skiing,  snowshoeing,  walking, horseback riding, and the operation of all terrain vehicles, snowmobiles,  and motor vehicles"  (2009 Order at 5). The 2009 Order further states that "the towns may be liable for any adverse consequences to drivers, to their vehicles, and . . . to other users of the road" from motor vehicle use on Old Mountain Road (id.).</p><p>Department staff  indicates that the 2009 Order creates a new legal obligation whereby the Towns will need to take action (i.e., cutting trees and vegetation, removing materials, filling wetlands, and destroying the natural environment) to widen and improve Old Mountain Road to make it suitable for motor vehicles.  Staff  contends<page number="18" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> that such actions conflict with Article 14 of the New York State Constitution, the Executive Law, the Master Plan, and judicial precedent. Staff  also references the "forever wild" provision in the State Constitution (see NY Const, art XIV, § 1). Staff  further argues that constructing a highway  through Forest Preserve  land "would be anathema to Article 14 of our State Constitution" (Staff  brief at 33), and that neither town has the authority to widen and improve Old Mountain Road to make it suitable for motor vehicles  (see id.).</p><p>Staff  contends that the scope of the 2009 Order should have been limited to the rights and responsibilities of respondent McCulley, the respondent in this matter. Because neither the Town of North Elba nor the Town of Keene was a party to the proceeding, and because such pronouncements regarding perceived responsibilities could unduly affect the rights of the two Towns, Department staff  maintains that "it was inappropriate to speculate as to [the towns'] obligations" (Staff  brief at 37) and such assertions are "outside the scope of the proceeding and beyond the department's jurisdiction" (id. at 38).</p><p>Department staff's  argument is compelling. Neither the<page number="19" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> Town of North Elba nor the Town of Keene was a party in this proceeding and the extent of their obligations, if any, was not at issue. Any statements as to their obligations was beyond the scope of the proceeding. Furthermore the record of the proceeding did not provide a basis to direct that the Towns undertake any of the remedial actions referenced in the 2009 Order with respect to Old Mountain Road. Accordingly, the discussion in the 2009 Order regarding the Towns' obligations over the road (see 2009 Order at 5) and jurisdictional responsibilities of the Towns or their highway  departments (see 2009 Order at 2-5) is hereby vacated. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">ATV and Snowmobile  Use of a Highway </emphasis></p><p>Department staff  seeks to clarify  whether ATV and snowmobile  use of a highway  is lawful where a town has not opened that highway.  Specifically, staff  seeks clarification  of the statement in the 2009 Order that "both towns [of Keene and North Elba] bear the responsibility to maintain [Old Mountain Road] in a way that will allow safe passage for the multitude of uses on it, including...the operation of all terrain vehicles, snowmobiles,  and motor vehicles"  (Staff  brief at 38 [quoting 2009 Order at 5]). As I have<page number="20" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/>  vacated  that portion of the 2009 Order on the ground that any discussion of the responsibilities of the Towns was beyond the scope of the proceeding, this request for clarification  is moot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Filing of a Certificate  of Abandonment </emphasis></p><p>Department staff  seeks clarification  of that portion of the 2009 Order that states "the road is deemed abandoned  when the town superintendent,  based on written consent of the town board majority, files a description of the highway  abandoned  with the town clerk" (see 2009 Order at 3). Staff  argues that this misstates the requirements for abandonment  pursuant to Highway Law  § 205(1) -- specifically that a town's highway  superintendent  must file a certificate  of abandonment  for a highway  to be abandoned.  Staff  argues that such filing is merely a ministerial act and the failure to file the certificate  does not affect whether a highway  has been abandoned  by six (6) years of non-use (see Staff  brief at 8-9). The Adirondack Council advances the same argument that the filing of the certificate  of abandonment  is a ministerial act and the failure to file the certificate  does not preclude abandonment  (Adirondack Council reply  at 6).</p><p>Section 205(1) of the Highway <page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> Law states in relevant part:</p><p>[E]very highway  that shall not have been traveled or used as a highway  for six years, shall cease to be a highway,  and every public right of way that shall not have been used for said period shall be deemed abandoned  as a right-of-way.  The town superintendent. ..shall file, and cause to be recorded in the town clerk's office of the town a written description, signed by him, and by said town board of each highway  and public right-of-way  so abandoned. ..</p><p>New York courts have held that the filing of a certificate  of abandonment  by the town superintendent  is a ministerial act, and if the evidence demonstrates that the road has been abandoned  by six years of non-use, then the road is deemed abandoned  by operation of law, not by filing the certificate  (see e.g. <citation type="case" normalizedCite="13 A.D.3d 790,at 792"><content>Abess v Rowland, <span normalizedCite="13 A.D.3d 790">13 AD3d 790<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000013#000790#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="13 A.D.3d 790">792<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000013#000790#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [3d Dept. 2004]; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="169 A.D.2d 914,at 916"><content>Matter of Faigle v Macumber, <span normalizedCite="169 A.D.2d 914">169 AD2d 914<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000169#000914#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="169 A.D.2d 914">916<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000169#000914#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [3d Dept. 1991]; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="149 A.D.2d 864,at 865"><content>Daetsch v Taber, <span normalizedCite="149 A.D.2d 864">149 AD2d 864<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000149#000864#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="149 A.D.2d 864">865<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000149#000864#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [3d Dept. 1989]; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="236 A.D.2d 889,at 890"><content>Matter of Wills v Town of Orleans, <span normalizedCite="236 A.D.2d 889">236 AD2d 889<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000236#000889#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="236 A.D.2d 889">890<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000236#000889#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [4th Dept. 1997]; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="185 A.D.2d 659"><content>Pless v Town of Royalton, <span normalizedCite="185 A.D.2d 659">185 AD2d 659<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000185#000659#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="185 A.D.2d 659">659<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000185#000659#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation><page number="22" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Staff  argues that recreational  uses "and even snowmobiling and ATVing do not constitute travel  or use of a route for highway  purposes" and that the road's purpose must be considered in order to determine whether it is, in fact, a highway  or simply a trail (Staff  brief at 17-18).</p><p>Whether recreational  activities are sufficient to preclude abandonment  is a fact-specific determination, dependent upon the type and intensity of the recreational  activity and where that activity occurs. However, in this instance, based on the Master Plan and the<page number="23" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> record before me, I hold that Old Mountain Road had been closed and abandoned  and no legal right-of-way  for public use  exists. Therefore, Department staff's  request for clarification  is moot.</p><p>Department staff  also requests that I clarify  "how recreational  uses that are incompatible with normal highway  uses should be weighed in any similar future case regarding violations of 6 NYCRR Part 190 or 196" (Staff  brief at 24). Because of the fact-specific nature of any such determination, I decline to address staff's  request regarding future cases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Dismissal of the Case</emphasis></p><p>Department staff  seeks to clarify  the language used in the 2009 Order regarding staff's  failure to meet  its burden of proof  and whether the case was dismissed as a matter of law  or for failure to meet  its burden of proof.  For example, the 2009 Order states that "Department staff  did not meet its burden in this matter" (2009 Order at 1-2) or demonstrate that "Old Mountain Road was, as a matter of law,  an abandoned  road pursuant to [the] Highway Law  . . . or that the road is not a legal right-of-way  for public use"  (id. at 6).</p><p>I recognize the potential ambiguity arising out of the cited language. In this proceeding, <page number="24" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 30"/> Department staff  bore the burden of proof  on all charges and matters affirmatively asserted in its complaint against respondent (see 6 NYCRR 622.11[b][1]). The 2009 Order dismissed staff's  complaint on the ground that Department staff  failed to meet its burden of proof.  As previously noted, I am however vacating various portions of the 2009 Order.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>As previously stated, this Decision and Ruling does not, in any way, affect the dismissal of the enforcement action  against James W. McCulley. However, it was a critical omission for the Master Plan not to be proffered on the issue of the status of Old Mountain Road for the Commissioner's consideration. The Master Plan and the related legal arguments in the submitted papers, as well as the record below, make it clear that Old Mountain Road had been closed and abandoned  and that no legal right-of-way  for public use  existed.</p><p>Accordingly, other than the dismissal of the charges against respondent James W. McCulley, I am hereby vacating those portions of the 2009 Order that (a) concluded that Old Mountain Road was a town road that had not been abandoned;  (b) concluded that Old Mountain Road is a legal right-of-way  for public<page number="25" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Project Proposed in 2003 DEIS</emphasis></p><p>At one time, in addition to hotels and other lodgings,  applicant considered including three 18-hole golf courses, one 9-hole par three course, and up to 100,000 square feet of retail space (see 2003 DEIS at xx-xxi). By the time of the issues conference in 2004, however, two golf <page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> courses were planned and the retail space had been reduced to 13,000 square feet (see id.). Set forth below are the major components of the proposed project  that were under consideration at the time of the issues conference. The proposal then before the Department included development on Big Indian Plateau to the east of the BMSC and Wildacres Resort  to the west of the BMSC.</p><p>1. Big Indian Plateau</p><p>The Big Indian Plateau development was to include Big Indian Country Club, Big Indian Resort  and Spa, and the Belleayre Highlands. Among their amenities, Big Indian Country Club included one 18-hole golf course,  a clubhouse and 95 detached lodging  units; Big Indian Resort  and Spa included a 150 room luxury hotel with two restaurants, a ballroom and a spa; and Belleayre Highlands included 88 detached lodging  units, a social/activities center, a swimming pool and tennis courts (see 2003 DEIS at 2-1 to 2-2).</p><p>2. Wildacres</p><p>The Wildacres development was to include Wildacres Resort,  Highmount Estates and the Wilderness Activity Center. Among their amenities, Wildacres Resort  included one 18-hole golf course  and clubhouse, a 250 room hotel, up to 13,000 square feet of retail space, three restaurants, <page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> a conference center, a ballroom, a spa and 168 detached lodging  units with a separate clubhouse; Highmount Estates was to include a 21 lot subdivision for single-family homes; and the Wilderness Activity Center was planned as a four season facility, primarily utilizing existing buildings at the former Highmount Ski Area, to offer a variety of recreational activities and outdoor oriented retail space (see 2003 DEIS at 2-2 to 2-3).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">B. The 2007 Agreement in Principle ("AIP")</emphasis></p><p>As noted, after issuance  of the Interim Decision in December 2006, the parties to the proceeding negotiated modifications  to the project that were memorialized in the AIP. The State of New York and nine of the issues conference parties signed the AIP. <footnote><anchor id="fnote5_30_362_174"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p> As set forth in the AIP, the nine issues conference parties that signed the AIP were: Catskill Center for Conservation and Development; City of New York, Department of Environmental  Protection; applicant Crossroads Ventures, LLC; Natural Resources Defense Council; New York Public Interest Research Group; Riverkeeper, Inc.; Theodore Gordon Flyfishers, Inc.; Trout Unlimited; and Zen Environmental  Studies Institute (see 2013 <citation type="case" normalizedCite="1 P. 1"><content>SDEIS, Appendix <span normalizedCite="1 P. 1">1 P 1<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#206#3#000001#000001#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> and unnumbered signature pages). For a listing of all the issues conference parties, see Section III. A below.</p></bodyText></footnote> The AIP sets forth the parameters for a modified  project described as a "lower impact alternative" to the proposal that was set forth in the 2003 DEIS (2013 SDEIS, Appendix A P 10). As stated in the AIP, the signatories "negotiated in good faith to resolve their outstanding issues related to the originally proposed project for the Belleayre Resort  at Catskill Park [and] reached agreement that this lower impact alternative is preferable" (id.).</p><p><page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/><br/>The most significant modification  of the proposed project  under the AIP was the complete elimination  of development on Big Indian Plateau (see Draft Final Environmental  Impact Statement ["draft FEIS"] at i). Much of the discussion at the 2004 issues conference focused on that parcel. It was contended that development of Big Indian Plateau posed substantive and significant environmental  issues, and several of the issues that advanced to adjudication concerned development of that parcel (for example, the water supply application, stormwater  management, and noise  and visual  impacts). In that regard, concerns were expressed about the topography and steep terrain of Big Indian Plateau, and that the terrain was steeper than Wildacres (see Issues Ruling at 71 [noting potential implications of steep slopes  and soil type at Big Indian Plateau]). <footnote><anchor id="fnote6_32_419_269"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p> As stated in the Department's 2010 Stormwater  Management Design Manual ("2010 Design Manual"), "[p]reserving steep slopes  and building on flatter areas helps to prevent soil erosion and minimizes stormwater   runoff"  (2010 Design Manual at 5-11; see also 2015 Design Manual update at 5-10 [stating same principle]). Stormwater  flow from Big Indian Plateau through tributaries to the Esopus Creek, which is within the Ashokan Reservoir Watershed Basin, was also raised as a concern. Both the Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir are listed as impaired waters pursuant to section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act (see DEC, Final New York State 2014 Section 303[d] List of Impaired Waters Requiring a TMDL/Other Strategy, Sept. 2014 ["2014 List of Impaired Waters"] at 8 [Sept. 2014]; Issues Ruling at 71 [noting that Esopus Creek "is on the New York State Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters"]). In contrast, Wildacres is almost entirely within the Pepacton Reservoir Watershed (only about 12 acres  are within the Ashokan Reservoir Watershed Basin) and its stormwater  will generally flow to Emory Brook (see 2013 SDEIS at 2-33 to 2-34, Drawing 2?34). The Pepacton Reservoir is not considered impaired for construction related pollutants (see Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014, P 16).</p></bodyText></footnote> The AIP provided for the eventual acquisition by the State of New York of the Big Indian Plateau property where applicant had proposed development (see 2013 SDEIS at 1-3; see also applicant, Ruzow Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, at P 21).</p><p><page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/><br/>Pursuant to the terms of the AIP, the eastern portion of Wildacres was to be reconfigured "to minimize land disturbance and steep slope  disturbance to the extent practicable" (AIP P 15, at 3). The 21-lot residential subdivision proposed in the western portion of Wildacres was eliminated although other development was proposed for that area (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="1 P. 1,at 3"><content><span normalizedCite="1 P. 1">id. at 3-4).<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#206#3#000001#000001#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> The AIP also addressed green building design, management of the golf course  at Wildacres as organic, stormwater  protocols, and an independent stormwater  monitor, among other matters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">C. Project Proposed in 2013 SDEIS</emphasis></p><p>As noted, the proposed project  has undergone substantial revisions since it was originally proposed in 1999. For clarity, the proposed project  that is currently before the Department will be referred to as the "modified  project" or the "Modified  Belleayre Resort  at Catskill Park." The modified  project is set forth in great detail in the 2013 SDEIS (see e.g. 2013 SDEIS, Section 2). Its most significant elements are discussed below. The modified  project would be located on lands to the west and north of the BMSC. The modified  project includes (1) Wildacres Resort,  located on approximately<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> 254 acres  on the eastern side of the project site;  and (2) Highmount Spa Resort,  located on approximately 237 acres  on the western side of the project site  (2013 SDEIS at 1 to 4; draft FEIS at iv-viii).</p><p>Wildacres Resort  will include a 250 unit hotel with up to 13,000 square feet of retail space, two restaurants, a conference center, ballrooms, and a full service spa. Highmount Golf Club, an 18-hole championship golf course  and clubhouse (connected to the hotel), will be located in the Wildacres development. This area will also include 163 detached lodging  units in multi-unit buildings with a separate clubhouse. Wildacres will include the Wilderness Activity Center, a four season facility, primarily utilizing existing buildings at the former HighmountSki Area, which would offer a variety of recreational activities and outdoor oriented retail space (2013 SDEIS at 2-4 to 2-7; see also 2013 SDEIS, Drawings 2-1 and 2-11).</p><p>Highmount Spa Resort,  the smaller of the two developments in the modified  project, will include a 120 unit hotel with spa facilities, 53 fractional ownership units located within the hotel facility, a multi-level lodge with 27 fractional share units, and 16 detached<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> lodgings  (located within eight buildings). Additionally, a conference center or clubhouse facility will be developed using existing buildings from a former farm complex, and a ski lift will be installed to transport guests from the lodging  facilities to the top of the old HighmountSki Area (2013 SDEIS at 2-2 to 2-4; see also 2013 SDEIS, Drawings 2-1 and 2-2).</p><p>The 2013 SDEIS and the draft FEIS both provide a tabular summary of some significant differences between the modified  project and the project as proposed under the 2003 DEIS. For example, impervious surfaces, a contributor to stormwater runoff,  have been reduced from 85 acres  under the 2003 DEIS plan to 21 acres  <footnote><anchor id="fnote7_39_566_14"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p> This number is also reported as 27 acres  in the 2013 SDEIS (see e.g. table 5-1). The higher number appears to reflect the impervious acres  that would have been created under the AIP rather than those that would be created under the modified  project (see id. table 5-2; see also <citation type="case" normalizedCite="1 P. 1,at 2"><content><span normalizedCite="1 P. 1">id. at 2-23<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#206#3#000001#000001#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> to 2-26 [calculation and narrative description of impervious acres  indicating 18 impervious acres  at Wildacres and 3 at Highmount, for a total of 21 acres] ). It is reported as 21 acres  in the draft FEIS.</p></bodyText></footnote> under the modified  project. The number of acres  to be developed has been reduced from 573 to 218. New road construction has been decreased from 8.2 miles to 1.5 miles, and the miles of roads on steep slopes  (i.e., slopes  of&gt; 20%) have been reduced from 5.1 miles to 0.1 (one-tenth of a mile) (2013 SDEIS at 5-5; draft FEIS at ii). The tabular summary in the 2013 SDEIS also illustrates further reductions that were made from what was proposed in the AIP (2013 SDEIS at 5-5 [for example, reductions in acreage to be developed]). <page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/></p><p>The 2013 SDEIS also highlights some of the "qualitative improvements" of the modified  project (2013 SDEIS at 5-3 to 5-4). These improvements include: eliminating nearly all stormwater  discharges to the Ashokan Reservoir and Watershed (as previously noted, this watershed includes waters that are listed as impaired pursuant to section 303[d] of the Federal Clean Water Act); committing to green building design, and to obtaining Silver certification or higher under the U.S. Green Building Council LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental  Design) program, for the Wildacres Hotel, Highmount Hotel, and Highmount Lodge; committing to organic golf course  management<page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Attached to Riverkeeper's letter are an e-mail exchange with applicant that included revisions to pages 87-89 of the draft FEIS to address Riverkeeper's concerns and an e-mail from Department staff  indicating that the revisions were acceptable to Department staff.  The revisions are to be included in the FEIS.</p><p>NRDC and CCCD filed papers noting concerns over specific aspects of the modified  project or seeking further assurances in relation to commitments already made by applicant under the AIP. NRDC submitted a letter in which it states that "NRDC recommends that [certain concerns] be addressed prior to cancellation of the administrative<page number="20" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The concerns that NRDC raised primarily relate to ensuring that applicant abides by the commitments in the AIP regarding future development and use of the project area. Applicant, as noted (see footnote 5 of this decision and ruling), is a signatory to the AIP and is governed by its terms and conditions. Specifically, NRDC objects to cancellation of the administrative proceeding until:</p><p>--final deed restriction language that forecloses the option of casino gambling on the site  and final arrangements for adding such language to the deeds have been agreed to by the developers and the parties;</p><p>--final deed restriction language on density limitations and final arrangements for adding such language to the deeds have been agreed to by the developers and the parties; and</p><p>--applicant reaffirms its commitment to manage the golf course  as organic and until requirements to manage the golf course  as organic and to establish a technical review committee are incorporated into the applicable SPDES permit (NRDC Letter, Nov. <page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

CCCD, however, reiterated its concerns regarding stormwater  impacts. CCCD indicated that it did not have sufficient engineering expertise to review and comment on the practices and procedures detailed in the project's stormwater  pollution prevention plan. It alleges a discrepancy between the draft SPDES permit and the language in the AIP concerning the independent storm  water monitor, differences between inspection requirements in the AIP and the draft SPDES permit, and differences between the definition of a qualified inspector in Appendix A of the SPDES permit with the definition of the independent storm  water monitor in the AIP (CCCD Letter, Nov. 17, 2014, at <page number="22" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Summary of Positions</emphasis></p><p>Department staff  maintains that no issues remain for adjudication and, therefore, the "hearing should be cancelled and the entire matter should be remanded to DEC staff  for acceptance of the Final Environmental  Impact Statement, issuance  of findings, and permit issuance"  (staff  Memorandum of Law, Sept. <page number="25" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Staff  contends that the modified  project renders all of the issues ("adjudicable  issues") that had been identified for adjudication under the 2006 Interim Decision as either moot  or no longer substantive and significant. Therefore, staff  argues, none of those issues remains adjudicable.  Staff  reiterated its position in its December 8, 2014 reply papers and, with regard to any newly  proposed issues ("proposed issues") that parties or petitioners raised concerning the modifications  to the project, staff  argues that none of the proposed issues are substantive and significant" (see staff  Memorandum of Law, Dec. 8, 2014, at 5).</p><p>Only two parties, FCP and CHA, filed papers in opposition to staff's  motion. Each of the petitioners (the Gould Family, PUA, and Rainone) raised proposed issues for adjudication and opposed staff's  motion to cancel  the hearing.</p><p>FCP argues that the Commissioner lacks authority to cancel  the adjudicatory hearing  and, therefore, staff's  motion must be denied. FCP also argues that the motion to cancel  the hearing was improper because it was addressed to the Commissioner rather than to the assigned administrative law judge. In addition, FCP contends<page number="26" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> that the issues conference must be reconvened to consider new information relating to the proposed project  modifications  and to determine whether new adjudicable  issues have been raised. FCP submitted three affidavits that it alleges "show that either issues already set for adjudication are substantive and significant and/or that new substantive and significant issues exist as a result of the changes made in the project" (FCP, Feller Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 12).</p><p>CHA opposes staff's  motion to cancel  the adjudicatory hearing  on both procedural and substantive grounds. Procedurally, CHA argues that, once issues have been approved for adjudication, no authority exists to resolve adjudicable  issues by motion of a party solely as a result of modifications  to the application. CHA contends that most of the adjudicable  issues remain viable and must be advanced to hearing. CHA also maintains that the issues conference must be reconvened in order to consider newly  proposed issues that arise from the proposed modifications  to the project.

The Gould Family also argues that applicant has failed to properly consider the alternative of developing the project without the Highmount component (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="1 P. 1,at 15"><content><span normalizedCite="1 P. 1">id. at 15-19).<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#206#3#000001#000001#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> PUA argues that visual  and noise  impacts from the proposed Highmount development, particularly in relation to the Galli-Curci Mansion,  have not been properly considered (see PUA Petition for Party Status, Nov. 17, 2014, P 15). Rainone argues that applicant's stormwater  analysis is flawed and that runoff  from the project site  will present a significant health and safety risk to petitioner's person and property (see Rainone Petition for Party Status, Dec. 30, 2014, at P 5 [listing 5 grounds for opposition relative to a storm  water permit]).</p><p>The positions and arguments advanced by the parties and petitioners are more fully discussed in the sections below which detail the adjudicable  issues and proposed issues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">IV. Discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">A. Authority to Decide Staff's  Motion</emphasis></p><p>As an initial matter, some<page number="28" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> of the filings in response to Department staff's  motion to cancel  the adjudicatory hearing  question whether the motion is properly before me (see e.g. FCP Memorandum of Law, Nov. 17, 2014, at 12 [stating that "[u]nder no circumstances should pending motions be determined by anyone other than the assigned ALJ"]; CHA, Caffry Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 73 [arguing that "[b]ecause ALJ Wissler has been assigned to the case, . . . the pending motions and cross-motions (other than the motion to reconsider) must be decided by ALJ Wissler"]). Generally, these filings question whether I am authorized, as the Commissioner of Environmental  Conservation, to determine the instant motion. For the reasons stated below, I hold that staff's  motion was properly directed to my attention and, accordingly, I will consider the merits of the motion.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Environmental  Conservation Law ("ECL"), the Commissioner of Environmental  Conservation has broad authority to administer the environmental  laws and policies of the State (see e.g. ECL 3-0301[1][b] [granting the Commissioner the power to "[p]romote and coordinate management of water, land, fish, wildlife and air resources to assure their<page number="29" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> protection . . . and balanced utilization consistent with the environmental  policy of the state . . . in making any determination in connection with any license, order, permit, certification or other similar action"]). With regard to hearings in particular, the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services ("OHMS") conducts hearings under my authority (see ECL 3-0301[2][h] [authorizing the Department "by and through" the Commissioner to "[c]onduct investigations and hold hearings"]). Further, as expressly set forth in the delegation of authority by which ALJs are designated, all determinations made by ALJs are "subject to modification  by the Commissioner and nothing contained [in this delegation of authority] shall limit [the Commissioner's] authority to convene or conduct hearings or to make or render determinations or decisions" (Delegation of Authority 14-02, dated July 15, 2014 [a copy of which is enclosed with this decision and ruling]).</p><p>Staff's  motion essentially seeks reconsideration of the 2006 Interim Decision of the Deputy Commissioner in light of the subsequent negotiations of the parties and the significant modifications  to the project (see e.g. Matter of Department of Envtl<page number="30" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> Protection of City of New York, Ruling of the Commissioner on Motion for Clarification and Partial Reconsideration, Sept. 2, 2010, at 2-3 [Commissioner has inherent authority to reconsider prior decisions]). Thus, it is appropriate for staff's  motion to be addressed to and decided by the Commissioner in the first instance. Nothing in Part 624 requires such a motion for reconsideration of a prior Commissioner interim decision to be decided in the first instance by an ALJ.</p><p>To the extent assertions are made that the regulations require submission of staff's  motion to an ALJ, the hearings regulations themselves expressly provide that "[t]o avoid prejudice to any party . . . any . . . rule may be modified  by the commissioner upon recommendation of the ALJ or upon the commissioner's initiative" (6 NYCRR 624.6[g]). It is, of course, prejudicial to require an applicant to bear the expense and delay of an adjudicatory hearing  if all proposed issues have been satisfactorily addressed in the record (see e.g. Matter of Bonded Concrete, Inc., Interim Decision of the Commissioner, June 4, 1990, at 2 [holding that, where an offer of proof is rebutted by the record, "it would be a disservice to<page number="31" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> the applicant and the public at large to proceed any further with time consuming and costly litigation"]). Moreover, to remand the proceeding to an ALJ at this stage for further interim review that may only return to my office on administrative appellate review would add little, if anything, to the process and would add unnecessary delay and expense.</p><p>As discussed in sections I and II of this decision and ruling, this project has been the subject of extensive review by the Department and the public. A number of parties that had opposed earlier iterations of the project have now withdrawn their objections to the modified  project set forth in the 2013 SDEIS. Department staff  has also withdrawn its prior objections to the project and, as its motion to cancel  the adjudicatory hearing  reflects, staff  now supports issuance  of the permits necessary for the modified  project. Notably, OHMS has not been involved in this matter since 2007, when the assigned ALJ granted applicant's motion to suspend the adjudicatory hearing  (see Matter of Crossroads Ventures, LLC , ALJ Ruling, Oct. 19, 2007). <footnote><anchor id="fnote12_80_1233_157"/><label>12</label><bodyText><p> Subsequent to the October 19, 2007 ruling, Friends of Catskill Park, Catskill Heritage Alliance and the Pine Hill Water Coalition moved, by notice of motion dated December 7, 2007, for a determination that the ALJ and OHMS exclusively had the authority to make SEQRA determinations on behalf of the DEC in this proceeding, subject to appeal to the Office of the Commissioner. By motion dated December 21, 2007, the same three parties moved for a determination that the project in the September 2007 AIP must be reviewed as a new project and not as a mere modification  of the project. The ALJ denied both motions. With respect to the first motion, the ALJ noted that the Agreement in Principle and the preparation of any supplemental draft environmental  impact statement thereto was not before him (see Matter of Crossroads Ventures, LLC, ALJ Ruling on Motions Addressing Post-Referral SEQRA Determinations and SEQRA Status of Agreement in Principle, March 3, 2008, at 5). The ALJ also denied the second motion on the ground that no jurisdiction existed for him to entertain the motion (see id.). By motion dated March 28, 2008, Friends of Catskill Park, Catskill Heritage Alliance and the Pine Hill Water Coalition sought an order disqualifying Commissioner Alexander B. Grannis from taking part in this or any further proceeding regarding the September 2007 AIP and directing that any ex parte communications between the Commissioner or his office and any party to the proceeding be disclosed. The motion was denied on the grounds that the movants failed to identify any ground for the Commissioner's disqualification in this proceeding, nor did any such ground exist (see Matter of Crossroads Ventures, LLC, Ruling of the Commissioner, April 29, 2009, at 5), and that no ex parte communications had occurred (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="1 P. 1,at 8"><content><span normalizedCite="1 P. 1">id. at 8).<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#206#3#000001#000001#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation></p></bodyText></footnote> Under the unique circumstances of this proceeding, I am satisfied that Department staff's  motion<page number="32" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

ENV LEXIS 29"/><br/>In this decision and ruling, I will consider (i) whether issues that were identified for adjudication under the Interim Decision remain adjudicable,  and (ii) whether newly  proposed issues arising from modifications  to the project are adjudicable.  Issues falling within the first category will be evaluated on the basis of whether the issue under consideration continues to meet the criteria for adjudication under 6 NYCRR 624.4(c). Issues falling within the second category will be evaluated both on the basis of (i) whether they are timely (i.e., whether, despite the changes to the project, the proposed issue was addressed and resolved by the Interim Decision or should have been raised in the proceeding leading to the Interim Decision), and (ii) whether the proposed issue is substantive and significant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">B. Standards for Adjudicable  Issues</emphasis></p><p>1. Issues Determined to be Adjudicable  under the Interim Decision</p><p>Where issues have been advanced to adjudication pursuant to an interim decision, it is preferable that these issues be removed from the hearing process through a stipulation executed by all parties (see 6 NYCRR 624.13[d]). In the absence of such a stipulation, the Department has <page number="34" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> been cautious in modifying determinations regarding adjudicable  issues made pursuant to an interim decision (see Matter of Westchester County [NYC Water Rate], Second Interim Decision of the Commissioner, Dec. 14, 1994, at 1 [holding that additional comments from the parties provided "no basis to modify the Interim Decision"]; see also Matter of Southern Dutchess Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., Interim Decision of the Deputy Commissioner, March 9, 2006, at 29-30 [stating "(m)y consideration of the Tributary Assessment Report at this stage, without affording an opportunity for the other parties to be heard, would deprive Department staff  and the other parties of an opportunity to participate and comment in any review. In this instance, the adjudicatory hearing  is the proper forum to consider the report"]). Nevertheless, where circumstances warrant the cancellation of an adjudicatory hearing,  the Department will do so even in the absence of a stipulation (see e.g. Matter of County Line Field, Decision of the Assistant Commissioner, Aug. 24, 2005, at 2-3 [cancelling the adjudicatory hearing  where issues advanced to adjudication under an interim decision were rendered moot  by changes to the western<page number="35" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> boundary of a natural gas field]).</p><p>Here, the reduction in anticipated environmental  impacts arising from the substantial changes to the project (as a result, in part, of the AIP) and the considerable additional environmental  analysis that applicant undertook warrant reassessment of the issues that the Interim Decision advanced to adjudication. These changes, as reflected in the 2013 SDEIS and the draft FEIS, were subject to public comment and review. Importantly, on the basis of the changes to the project, Department staff  has revised its position and now supports issuance  of the permits necessary for the modified  project.</p><p>I also note that, subsequent to the filing of Department staff's  motion, parties to the proceeding have been afforded a full opportunity to respond to the motion and I have given careful consideration to the submissions received. In addition, I have given careful consideration to the new petitions for party status received in November and December of 2014 (as noted, a listing of the submissions received is attached to this decision and ruling as Appendix II).</p><p>For those issues that were determined to be adjudicable  under the Interim Decision and as all parties<page number="36" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> have not stipulated to the modified  project, I deem it appropriate to place the burden of proof on Department staff,  which is the party seeking to eliminate those issues from adjudication (see also 6 NYCRR 624.9[b][4] [providing that "[t]he burden of proof to sustain a motion will be on the party making the motion"]).</p><p>I note that CHA argues that a hearing may not be cancelled on the motion of one party "solely as a result of modifications  to the application" (CHA, Caffry Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 5). This is incorrect. Where modifications  to a proposed project  eliminate entirely a component of a project, issues pertaining to that component are moot  (see e.g. Matter of Jointa Galusha, LLC, Interim Decision of the Commissioner, May 7, 2002, at 7 [dismissing an issue from adjudication because "the Intervenors' concerns [were] rendered moot"  by modification  of the applicant's proposed project] ). Clearly, if the elimination  of part of a project, or other modification  of the project, rendered some or all adjudicable  issues moot,  it would serve no legitimate purpose to proceed to adjudication on those issues.</p><p>Where, as here, no dispute exists between Department staff  and the applicant, an<page number="37" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> issue proposed for adjudication must be both substantive and significant (see 6 NYCRR 624.4[c][1][iii]). Staff's  determination not to adjudicate an issue will be upheld, and "a substantive and significant issue will not be found," if staff's  determination is "reasonable and supported by the record" (Matter of Seneca Meadows, Inc., Interim Decision of the Commissioner, Oct. 26, 2012, at 4-5 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]).</p><p>An issue is substantive "if there is sufficient doubt about the applicant's ability to meet statutory or regulatory criteria applicable to the project, such that a reasonable person would require further inquiry" (6 NYCRR 624.4[c][2]). In determining whether sufficient doubt exists, the decision maker must consider the permit application and related documents, the draft permit, the content of petitions for party status, the record of the issues conference, and any authorized written arguments (see id.). An issue is significant if it has the potential to result in the denial of a permit, a major modification  to the proposed project,  or the imposition of significant permit conditions in addition to those proposed in the draft permit (see 6 NYCRR<page number="38" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> 624.4[c][3]).</p><p>Although Department staff  has the burden with respect to its motion, a party that seeks to challenge staff's  determination that an issue is no longer adjudicable  must do so by an appropriate offer of proof. With respect to the sufficiency of an offer of proof,</p><p>"[s]peculation, expressions of concern, general criticisms, or conclusory statements are insufficient to raise an adjudicable  issue. The qualifications of the expert witnesses that a petitioner identifies may also be subject to consideration at this stage. Even where an offer of proof is supported by a factual or scientific foundation, it may be rebutted by the application, the draft permit and proposed conditions, the analysis of Department staff,  or the record of the issues conference, among other relevant materials and submissions. In areas of Department staff  expertise, its evaluation of the application and supporting documentation is important in determining the adjudicability of an issue"</p><p>(Matter of Seneca Meadows, Inc., Interim Decision of the Commissioner, Oct. 26, 2012, at 4 [citations omitted]). In short, "offer[s] of proof are not made in a vacuum" and may be rebutted by the application, its supporting<page number="39" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

To raise such a new issue, the proponent must establish that the issue is both substantive and significant and support the issue with an adequate offer of proof (see 6 NYCRR 624.5[b][2]). Moreover, the burden of persuasion on new <page number="41" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Section 621.8 of 6 NYCRR serves as a basis for Department staff  to determine whether newly  proposed issues that were presented during the public comment period on the 2013 SDEIS and the draft permits for the modified  project warrant referral to OHMS for adjudication. The 2013 SDEIS and draft permits were publicly noticed and made available for comment in April 2013 (see ENB, Apr. 17, 2013; see also ENB, May 22, 2013). The ENB notice advised that a legislative public hearing to receive comments on the application and the 2013 SDEIS was to be held "[i]n accordance with the provisions of 6 NYCRR Parts 617 and 621" (id.). Where, as here, the legislative hearing is held pursuant to 6 NYCRR part 621, a primary purpose of the hearing is to gather public comments so that Department staff  may determine<page number="43" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> whether substantive and significant issues exist that warrant referral of the matter to OHMS (see 6 NYCRR 621.8[b], [d]). To be deemed substantive and significant, comments in "opposition to an application must explain the basis of that opposition and identify the specific grounds which could lead the department to deny or impose significant conditions on the permit" (6 NYCRR 621.8[d]). Further, "[m]ere expressions of general opposition to a project are insufficient grounds for holding an adjudicatory public hearing" (id.).</p><p>Department staff  evaluated comments on the modified  project that were received during the comment period on the 2013 SDEIS and draft permits. Each of the entities that are now raising proposed new issues had the opportunity to express their concerns during the Part 621 comment period. Based on its review of the project and the public comments received, Department staff's  position in its motion was that no new issues were raised that merited adjudication (see staff  Memorandum of Law, Dec. 8, 2014, at 11 n 3; staff,  Whitehead Aff, Sept. 8, 2014, PP 57-58). Staff's  determination regarding whether a given issue is, or is not, adjudicable  is subject to my review, <page number="44" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> and I retain discretion to overturn staff's  determination (see Matter of Monroe County, Interim Decision of the Commissioner, July 2, 1991, at 2; Matter of Town of Smithtown, Decision of the Commissioner, Sept. 21, 1989, at 6). As noted, based on my review in accordance with the substantive and significant standards of 6 NYCRR part 624, this record does not support the identification of any new issues for adjudication.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">C.

Issues # 6 and # 8: Water Supply Permit Issues and Aquatic Habitat Impacts</p><p>Adjudicable  issues # 6 and # 8 relate to the withdrawal of water from the Rosenthal Wells that were to supply water to the Big Indian Plateau development. Specifically, under Issue # 6, the issue for adjudication was "whether applicant's water supply permit application for Big Indian Plateau satisfied . . . regulatory requirements" (Interim Decision at 21). Under Issue # 8, the issue to be adjudicated  was whether, at the pumping rates proposed in the draft water supply permit for Big Indian Plateau, the risk exists that dewatering would occur to the detriment of aquatic habitats" (see Interim Decision at 30-31).</p><p>As<page number="45" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Accordingly, issues relating to the development of Big Indian Plateau and the previously proposed water supply application relating to it are moot  (see e.g. staff,  Whitehead Aff, Sept.8, 2014, P 36).</p><p>2. Issue # 9: Stormwater  Issues</p><p>The Interim Decision advanced five stormwater  related subissues  to adjudication. Referring to the list of stormwater  subissues  as enumerated by the ALJ, the Interim Decision states that stormwater  subissues  "numbered '1,' '2,' '4,' '8' and '9' shall be adjudicated"  (Interim Decision at 41). These subissues  are described in the Issues Ruling as follows:</p><p>"(1) the adequacy of the HydroCAD model [a computer simulation model used to estimate stormwater  runoff] , its assumed inputs and design points, (2) stormwater  flow paths on the project sites,  . . . (4) the level of pre and post-development stormwater  flows, . . . (8) a permit condition delineating special conditions to be included in all waivers from the five acre  exposure limit<page number="46" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> during construction and (9) the adequacy of the Big Indian SWPPP [Stormwater  Pollution Prevention Plan] and the design of its various stormwater  management controls"</p><p>(Issues Ruling at 73-74).</p><p>As discussed in the Issues Ruling, Big Indian Plateau presented the greatest concern with regard to the potential stormwater  impacts of the proposed project  (see e.g. Issues Ruling at 71 [noting "the topography of Big Indian with its steep slopes  and humic soil"], 71-72 [noting that Big Indian Plateau is within the watershed of impaired waters that are already impacted by "silt and sedimentation due to streambank erosion"], 73 [noting concerns over the project's SWPPP "particularly the Big Indian Plateau portion"]; see also staff,  Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014,</p><p>PP 14-16 [attesting that the Big Indian Plateau development presented the greatest stormwater  impact concern because it "was proposed to be built on relatively steep slopes  and stormwater  runoff  from Big Indian would drain into water bodies that are listed as 'impaired'" while the modified  project is almost entirely within "[t]he Pepacton watershed [which] is not considered impaired for construction related pollutants (e.g., phosphorous<page number="47" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> and sediment)"]).</p><p>The elimination  of development that had been proposed for Big Indian Plateau also eliminates the stormwater  concerns associated with that component of the project.</p><p>In that regard, stormwater  subissue  "9" reflected the concern with the potential stormwater  impacts caused by development of Big Indian Plateau. By its express terms, stormwater  subissue  "9" is limited to the adequacy of the SWPPP for Big Indian Plateau, and the adequacy of the SWPPP for other components of the project was not deemed adjudicable  under the Interim Decision. Accordingly, with the elimination  of development on Big Indian Plateau, stormwater  subissue  "9" is eliminated in its entirety.</p><p>The principal arguments in opposition to cancelling adjudication of the stormwater  subissues  are raised by CHA. As an initial matter, I note that Department staff  argues that CHA's expert does not appear to have expertise in stormwater  management and "[a]rguably, [the expert's] affidavit should be completely disregarded because he lacks the requisite training and experience" (staff  Reply Memorandum of Law, Dec. 8, 2014, at 15 n 7). An expert's qualifications within the relevant field may be considered when<page number="48" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> weighing the merits of the arguments, opinions and factual assertions made by the parties (see Matter of Seneca Meadows, Inc., Interim Decision of the Commissioner, Oct. 26, 2012, at 4 [holding that "[t]he qualifications of the expert witnesses that a petitioner identifies may also be subject to consideration"]; Matter of Erie Boulevard Hydropower L.P., Decision of the Deputy Commissioner, Oct. 6, 2006, at 20 [holding that an offer of proof was insufficient, in part because the expert witness was "only minimally qualified to testify concerning the impact the [stream]  flows . . . will have on aquatic habitat"]).</p><p>Here, CHA proffers the affidavit of a professional engineer whose resume states that he has experience in "a wide range of engineering projects in the fields of solid and hazardous waste management, site  development, water and wastewater facilities, and environmental  permitting" (CHA, Millspaugh Aff, Nov. 12, 2014, <footnote><anchor id="fnote16_120_1774_137"/><label>16</label><bodyText><p> The parties and petitioners that oppose staff's  motion filed a total of five affidavits of Mr. Millspaugh (some of which were duplicates).</p></bodyText></footnote> attached resume at 1).

The expert's resume indicates that he has been exposed to stormwater  management issues, at least in the context of solid and hazardous waste sites.  Accordingly, notwithstanding the issues raised by staff  with regard to the expert's experience, I shall consider the affidavit of CHA's expert for the purposes of this proceeding.</p><p>Turning to the remaining stormwater  subissues  (nos. "1," "2," "4," and "8"), Department<page number="50" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> staff  argues that these are either moot  or no longer substantive and significant (staff  Memorandum of Law, Sept. 10, 2014, at 6-7). To the extent that these subissues  involved Big Indian Plateau, those aspects of the subissues  are now moot.  Staff  argues that stormwater  subissues  "1," "2," and "4" are no longer adjudicable  issues because the protocol developed in the AIP by applicant and other parties addresses these issues. Staff  states that the protocol has been "carried over" into applicant's SWPPP, which meets all permitting standards, and applicant will be required to adhere to the SWPPP under the terms of its individual SPDES permit (id. at 6; see also staff,  Whitehead Aff, Sept. 8, 2014, PP 40, 42; Draft SPDES Discharge Permit [No. NY-027 0679], Parts I.A, II.B.1). Staff  argues that subissue  "8" is no longer adjudicable  because applicant has agreed to enhanced stormwater  management requirements (which staff  has determined are acceptable) and must comply with these enhanced measures under the provisions of the draft SPDES permit (id. at 6-7; see also staff,  Whitehead Aff, Sept. 8, 2014, PP 41-42; Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014, P 24; applicant, Franke Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 39). <page number="51" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

CHA's expert asserts that "the requirements of the General Stormwater  Permit for Construction Activity do not appear to be satisfied [and] it is not clear how DEC can satisfy the hard look threshold under SEQRA" (CHA, Millspaugh Aff, Nov. 12, 2014, P 22).</p><p>Several of the objections raised by CHA's expert fall within subissues  "1" (the adequacy of the HydroCAD model, its assumed inputs and design points) and "4" (the level of pre- and post-development stormwater  flows). The expert asserts that applicant failed to properly evaluate<page number="52" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> the "substantial increase in total runoff  volume caused by the proposed project, " particularly with regard to construction "on the higher slopes  of Highmount" (CHA, Millspaugh Aff, Nov. 12, 2014, P 14). According to CHA's expert, "direct observations" of current site  conditions indicate that applicant used inaccurate assumptions regarding the capacity of the ditch along a portion of County Route 49A ("CR 49A") and that the road is already overtopped in that area by stormwater  flows under certain conditions (id. PP 16-17). This expert also asserts that applicant's calculations indicate that stormwater  runoff  volumes for the project will exceed pre-development levels at several locations, including one location on CR 49A where runoff  from the Highmount area will increase by 125% (id. P 19).</p><p>The record before me establishes that Department staff  has met its burden to demonstrate that none of the stormwater  subissues  continues to warrant adjudication. First, as noted earlier (see section II. C of this decision and ruling), applicant has agreed to implement a number of design features intended to mitigate impacts from stormwater  runoff.  Among these are applicant's commitment to green<page number="53" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> building design, including extensive use of green roofs; the near elimination  of roads and detached lodging  units on slopes  of greater than 20%; the use of organic golf course  management techniques, including the use of stormwater  controls to maximize collection of stormwater  runoff  for golf course  irrigation; and the use of more traditional stormwater  controls, such as retention ponds. As discussed below, through these and other stormwater  management measures, applicant has developed a plan that will result in no increase in stormwater  discharge rates from the project. Ms. Lamb-LaFay, in her affidavit, provides a detailed and substantive response that persuasively rebuts the assertions of CHA's consultant.</p><p>Both of Department staff's  stormwater  experts attest that the stormwater  management system developed for the modified  project will result in post-development stormwater  leaving the site  at a rate that is at or below the rate of discharge under pre-development conditions (staff,  Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014, P 27; Lamb-LaFay Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, PP 5-6, 12). This is true for both smaller storms  and for the "100 year 24 hour storm  event" (staff,  Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014, P 27; <page number="54" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> see also 2010 Design Manual at 4-11 [stating that the "<emphasis typeStyle="it">100 Year Control</emphasis> requires storage to attenuate the post development 100-year, 24-hour peak discharge rate . . . to predevelopment rates"]).</p><p>CHA's assertions that applicant used erroneous assumptions relative to existing stormwater  flows along a portion of CR 49A are not supported by the record. For example, CHA's expert contends that applicant used inaccurate measurements for a ditch along CR 49A. Staff,  however, notes that the existing ditches and culverts along CR 49A were re-verified in the field (staff,  Lamb-LaFay Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, P 11). Applicant's stormwater  model predicted that, consistent with CHA's direct observations, runoff  would overtop CR 49A under existing conditions during certain storm  events (id. P 8). The stormwater  model included in the 2013 SDEIS (Appendix 18) was supplemented to include a further analysis of conditions along CR 49A (see draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 94-96). The response noted that "[w]hen modeling the existing condition using field measured ditch dimensions and the weir overflow approach, if the capacity of the reach/ditch is exceeded . . . in order to get the most accurate <page number="55" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> results of peak flows at downstream design points, the size of the ditch must be increased until it has adequate capacity" (see id. at 95). Ms. Lamb-LaFay indicated that, in light of model predictions, in the existing condition of runoff  during the 10-year storm  event "the project was modified  to include improvements to the conveyance channel along Route CR-49A. These improvements . . . will act as a flow splitter to distribute flow from the smaller storm  events through the culverts and allow larger flows to continue in the channel without overtopping the road during the 25 year event. The predicted flow rates at each culvert are predicted to be at or below the existing flow rates for each event analyzed" (staff,  Lamb-LaFay Aff, Dec. 8, 2014,</p><p>P 8; see also draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 95-96).</p><p>Department staff  has determined that the proposed stormwater  management system is compliant with the 2010 Design Manual and is "designed to attenuate the post-development peak rate of runoff  for the ten and 100 year storm  events to pre-development rates thereby ensuring that impacts to waterbodies will be no greater than they are under the existing conditions" (staff,  Ferracane Aff, <page number="56" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> Nov. 20, 2014, P 27). Although not required to address preexisting stormwater  capacity issues along CR 49A, applicant has agreed to undertake reconstruction of the relevant stretch of CR 49A to correct existing stormwater  capacity issues (see id. P 28; draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 111; see also draft FEIS, Errata § 2.12 [Figures - Updated CR 49A Improvement Plans]).</p><p>Department staff  does not dispute CHA's assertion that, at three of the fifteen design points designated in applicant's Stormwater  Management Design Report ("stormwater  report"), "post-development [stormwater]  volume will exceed pre-development (existing) conditions" (CHA, Millspaugh Aff, Nov. 12, 2014, P 19). Staff  notes, however, that for each of the three design points, "the peak rate of discharge (the key indicator for downstream flooding) is decreased for all storm  events" (staff,  Lamb-LaFay Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, P 12 [providing a detailed discussion of each of the three design points referenced by CHA's consultant], see also id. PP 5-6). Staff's  position is further supported by the analysis contained in the stormwater  report (see draft FEIS, Errata § 2.2, Appendix C, table 7 [depicting pre- and post-development<page number="57" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> stormwater  rates and volumes for each design point under the 1, 10, 25 and 100 year design storm] ). In addition, staff  provides details which demonstrate that the modified  project will satisfy all runoff  reduction, channel protection, and green infrastructure requirements set forth under the 2010 Design Manual in relation to the three design points identified by CHA (staff,  Lamb-LaFay Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, PP 12-13).</p><p>Department staff  has met its burden to demonstrate that none of the stormwater  subissues  that had been advanced to adjudication under the Interim Decision remain substantive and significant. These subissues  do not raise a sufficient doubt about the applicant's ability to meet relevant statutory or regulatory criteria and do not have the potential to result in a major modification  of the proposed project  or the imposition of a significant new permit condition (see 6 NYCRR 624.4[c][2], [3]).</p><p>3. Issue # 12: Operational Noise  Issues</p><p>With regard to potential construction or operational noise  issues, the Interim Decision determined that "only the issue of operational noise  impacts on users of wilderness and wild forest areas of the Catskill Forest Preserve (in close proximity<page number="58" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> to the project) arising from onsite activities shall be adjudicated"  (Interim Decision at 59). To address this adjudicable  issue, applicant was directed to "undertake a noise  study that would take into account the onsite noise-generating activities" at Wildacres Resort  and Big Indian Plateau (id. at 57). As noted, with the elimination  of the development of Big Indian Plateau that portion of Issue # 12 is now moot. </p><p>CHA argues that operational noise  impacts on the Forest Preserve "have not been resolved by changes to the project or the SEIS, so this continues to be a substantive and significant issue for adjudication" (CHA, Caffry Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, at 8-9). CHA provides little elaboration or factual support for its position, but does reference its comment letter on the 2013 SDEIS (id. P 67, at 44-45). In that letter, CHA asserts that the noise  analysis failed to assess impacts on the "BMSC Intensive Use Area" and that noise  impacts "should be recalculated at the edge of the active ski area" (id., Exhibit ["Exh"] M at 24). As noted above, however, the adjudicable  issue identified under the Interim Decision was limited to operational noise  impacts on wilderness and wild forest areas. <page number="59" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> Accordingly, the issue of impacts on "intensive use areas" as referenced by CHA was not advanced to adjudication. <footnote><anchor id="fnote18_137_2240_119"/><label>18</label><bodyText><p> For the reasons set forth in the draft FEIS, I conclude that other noise  related issues raised in the CHA comment letter, such as purported deviations from the Department's noise  impact policy and the possible effect of seasonal changes, are lacking in merit and, therefore, not adjudicable  (see e.g. draft FEIS at 178-79, 184-185 [addressing these concerns]).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>With regard to the adjudicable  issue of the potential operational noise  impacts on users of wilderness and wild forest areas from onsite activities, applicant completed a noise  assessment that determined that no such impacts would occur (see 2013 SDEIS, Appendix 20). Specifically, applicant's noise  assessment determined that no change in ambient noise  levels on wilderness or wild forest lands would occur (see id. at 15-16 [concluding that no increase in daytime or nighttime ambient sound levels will occur at the nearest Forest Preserve lands classified as wilderness], tables 5-2 to 5-4 [indicating no increase in the ambient sound level at the State Forest Preserve from estimated nighttime continuous<page number="60" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> sound levels from project operation, and no increases in average ambient sound levels arising from daytime sound levels and nighttime (continuous and non-continuous project operations sound levels)]; draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 184 [stating that the noise  assessment for "the nearest point of wilderness, located in the Big Indian Wilderness area, approximately 1 mile from the Highmount hotel location [determined that] [n]o noise  impacts were predicted to occur at this location" and further stating that "[t]he nearest Wild Forest location . . . is located approximately 3 miles away and effects of noise  will be even less at this location"]).</p><p>Department staff,  based on the studies and assessments that were conducted, and which are set forth in the 2013 SDEIS and draft FEIS (see e.g. 2013 SDEIS §§ 3.7, 4.5 and Appendix 20 [Construction and Operations Noise  Study]; draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 178-79), concludes that the noise  issue is moot  (see staff  Reply Memorandum of Law, Dec. 8, 2014, at 22).</p><p>Based on the record, Department staff  has met its burden to demonstrate that the noise  issue that had been advanced to adjudication under the Interim Decision is no longer<page number="61" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> substantive and significant. Accordingly this issue will not be adjudicated. </p><p>4. Issue # 14: Visual  Impact Issues</p><p>The Interim Decision advanced two visual  impact issues to adjudication. The first adjudicable  issue was the extent of "visual  impacts caused by Big Indian Plateau in wintertime conditions" (Interim Decision at 68-69). With the removal of the Big Indian Plateau development from the project, this issue is moot. </p><p>As to the second adjudicable  issue relating to visual  impacts, the Interim Decision held that the "issue of light pollution is a substantive and significant issue that shall be adjudicated"  (Interim Decision at 69). The Interim Decision and the Issues Ruling indicate that light pollution impacts from Big Indian Plateau were the more significant concern (see Interim Decision at 69 [stating that "[t]he extent to which the area in the vicinity of Big Indian Plateau would be impacted by visible lights . . . is uncertain"]; Issues Ruling at 115 [stating that "[t]he problem of light pollution and sky glow could be particularly severe at the Big Indian Resort" ]). Nevertheless, the issue as advanced to adjudication was not expressly limited to Big Indian Plateau and has<page number="62" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> not been rendered entirely moot  by the elimination  of development on Big Indian Plateau.</p><p>As set forth in the Issues Ruling, the specific issue advanced to adjudication was "the failure to evaluate the impacts of light pollution" (Issues Ruling at 116; see also Interim Decision at 69 [concurring that the issue should be adjudicated] ). With regard to the modified  project, including the increased density of development in the Highmount area, the record shows that the potential impacts of light pollution have now been fully evaluated by applicant (see 2013 SDEIS Appendix 25, Part 2 [Belleayre Resort:  Assessment of Proposed Outdoor Lighting  ("lighting  assessment")]).</p><p>The lighting  assessment, undertaken by the Lighting  Research Center of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, concludes that the "roadways and parking lots at the Belleayre resort  will perform well in terms of light pollution, if implemented as designed" (lighting  assessment at 3). The only element of the modified  project that was found to emit "much greater than recommended" light was an outdoor tennis court complex (id. at 18). The lighting  assessment notes that the tennis courts "will contribute nearly 40% of the lumens <page number="63" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> produced by all the outdoor luminaires at the whole Resort"  (id. at 21). The assessment suggested various possible lighting  controls, including the use of foliage or high-opacity windscreen material to contain the light within the tennis court areas (see id. at 22-24).</p><p>Applicant has committed to minimizing outdoor lighting  at the resort  "to the maximum extent practicable consistent with security, safety and operational considerations" (AIP P 46) and this commitment is reflected in the 2013 SDEIS (see e.g. 2013 SDEIS at 2-44 [setting forth the lighting  plan for the modified  project and stating that the lighting  plan's goal "is to create a cohesive and uniform lit environment throughout the Resort  which focuses on safety, minimizing unwanted glare and light trespass to protect the night sky"]). Guidelines for lighting  are set forth for road corridors, resort  activity areas, and residential areas (see id. at 2-44 to 2-45). A description is provided regarding the lighting  at the tennis courts, and mitigation  measures for that lighting,  including an automatic shutoff system that will turn the tennis court lighting  off one hour after sunset (see 2013 SDEIS at 2-45).</p><p>Given the elimination <page number="64" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> of the Big Indian Plateau development, the results of the lighting  assessment, and applicant's commitment to minimizing light pollution that may emanate from the resort,  I conclude that neither of the adjudicable  issues set forth under Issue # 14 remains substantive and significant. Accordingly, the issues identified in the Interim Decision under Issue # 14 will not be adjudicated. </p><p>5. Issue # 18: Issues Concerning Alternatives Analysis</p><p>Pursuant to 6 NYCRR 617.9(b)(5)(v), a DEIS must contain "a description and evaluation of the range of reasonable alternatives to the action that are feasible, considering the objectives and capabilities of the project sponsor." Applicant provided an alternatives analysis as part of the 2003 DEIS and the Interim Decision held that "the descriptions of alternatives were, at least in part, reasonable and sufficiently detailed to permit comparative assessment" (Interim Decision at 89).</p><p>With regard to alternatives issues that were identified as adjudicable  by the ALJ, the Interim Decision modified  the Issues Ruling "to limit the adjudication to alternative layouts on Wildacres Resort  and Big Indian Plateau" and held that "the primary focus of the adjudicatory<page number="65" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> hearing on this issue should be the environmental  impacts associated with the alternative layouts rather than the economic feasibility of the alternatives" (Interim Decision at 94). As noted by applicant (applicant Memorandum of Law, Nov. 17, 2014, at 25-27), this approach is consistent with relevant case law (see id. at 25, citing, among other cases, <citation type="case" normalizedCite="208 A.D.2d 472,at 473"><content>Coalition Against Lincoln West, Inc. v City of New York, <span normalizedCite="208 A.D.2d 472">208 AD2d 472<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000208#000472#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="208 A.D.2d 472">473<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000208#000472#"/></locatorKey></locator></span> (1st Dept 1994),</content></citation> affd <citation type="case" normalizedCite="86 N.Y.2d 123"><content><span normalizedCite="86 N.Y.2d 123">86 NY2d 123 (1995)<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000086#000123#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>]).</content></citation> As stated in <citation type="case" normalizedCite="96 A.D.3d 754,at 755"><content>Matter of Kirquel Dev., Ltd. v Planning Bd. of Town of Cortlandt, <span normalizedCite="96 A.D.3d 754">96 AD3d 754<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000096#000754#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="96 A.D.3d 754">755<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000096#000754#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2d Dept 2012], lv denied <citation type="case" normalizedCite="19 N.Y.3d 813"><content><span normalizedCite="19 N.Y.3d 813">19 NY3d 813<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34042#3#000019#000813#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2012]), although SEQRA requires "a hard look at the environmental  impacts of the proposed project  . . .

ENV LEXIS 29"/> east resort  [Big Indian Plateau only]/west resort  [Wildacres only] alternative) and such additional smaller scale alternatives that would ensure that a reasonable range is considered" (Interim Decision at 93).</p><p>As noted, the proposed development on Big Indian Plateau has been abandoned, thereby eliminating the project's impacts on this area. This change renders moot  the Interim Decision's directive to consider alternative layouts for Big Indian Plateau. In addition, applicant asserts that this change addresses the directive under the Interim Decision "for consideration of a 'western alternative,' a single golf course  alternative, and a smaller-scale project alternative, since all of these alternatives became features of the Modified  Project" (applicant, Ruzow Aff, Nov.17, 2014, P 52).</p><p>While the elimination  of development on Big Indian Plateau clearly renders moot  the need to consider certain alternatives, the Interim Decision still requires applicant to consider alternative layouts for the various components of the project and also alternatives that would further reduce the scale of the project. As presented in the 2013 SDEIS and draft FEIS, applicant has fulfilled these requirements<page number="67" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> (see 2013 SDEIS, Section 5 [Alternatives]; draft FEIS, Executive Summary at xiii-xv; applicant, Ruzow Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, PP 51-58).</p><p>The 2013 SDEIS presents a comprehensive alternatives analysis comparing the 2003 DEIS plan and the modified  project. This comparison underscores the significant reduction in the overall size and scope of the proposed project  and identifies several environmental  impacts that have been eliminated or mitigated.</p><p>The modified  project alternative is also compared to the proposed plan under the AIP. The major difference between these two alternatives is that the AIP included 24 lodging  structures in the upper part of Highmount. The modified  project transfers the lodging  capacity of the 24 Highmount lodging  structures to Wildacres by adding another level to structures already planned for Wildacres. This eliminates the impacts of constructing the 24 units on the upper slopes  of Highmount while minimizing the potential increase in impacts of this relocation at Wildacres. The environmental  benefits of this change include eliminating the construction of 1.1 miles of road, the majority of which would be on slopes  of greater than 20%, and reducing the number of<page number="68" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> acres  of impervious surfaces for the entire project from 27 to 21 acres,  among other environmental  benefits (see 2013 SDEIS at 5-4 to 5-5).</p><p>Another alternative considered in the 2013 SDEIS is the complete elimination  of the development at Highmount (see 2013 SDEIS at 5-5 to 5-8). Applicant asserts that "without Highmount, the entire project would not be [economically] viable; nor would the project achieve the applicant's objectives of covering a wide range of the market and avoiding market segmentation" (applicant, Ruzow Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 56). The modified  project alternative eliminates development on the environmentally sensitive slopes  above the proposed Highmount Hotel which would have been developed under the AIP (draft FEIS at xiv). The use of green building design, including green roofs and underground parking reduces the number of impervious acres  (see 2013 SDEIS at 2-25). The alternatives analysis shows that, while the number of acres  to be disturbed by elimination  of development on Highmount would be reduced by 42 acres,  the number of impervious acres  would only be reduced by "approximately 3 acres  <footnote><anchor id="fnote19_157_2646_25"/><label>19</label><bodyText><p> On page 5-6 of the 2013 SDEIS this same figure is reported as "approximately 2 acres.

Appendix 5; draft FEIS, Errata § 2.8 [No Highmount Alternative Additional Analysis, at 2-4 (providing a comparison of environmental  impacts based on category - surface waters, groundwater, visual,  noise,  etc.)]; draft FEIS, Errata § 2.5 [HVS November 2013 Feasibility Study and Sensitivity Analysis (updating the feasibility analysis)]). I have considered CHA's argument for a Wildacres-only alternative (see CHA, Caffry Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, at 44), but the evaluation of alternatives presented in the 2013 SDEIS and draft FEIS does not support CHA's position. <footnote><anchor id="fnote20_159_2676_360"/><label>20</label><bodyText><p> The Gould Family, in its petition, criticizes the alternative analysis and argues for further consideration as to the environmental  impacts and potential elimination  of the Highmount development (see Gould Family Petition at 15-19).

C.2. of this decision and ruling, the issue will not be revisited here.</p><p>CHA sets forth what it terms an "additional issue" relating to the compliance of the permit applications with applicable regulations and that the application "will have significant unmitigated impacts on stormwater,  water quality, and erosion" (CHA, Caffry Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, at 37). CHA's arguments regarding stormwater-related issues and the statements of its expert, Mr. Millspaugh, were addressed previously in Section IV. C.2 of this decision and ruling. In his affidavit for the Gould Family, Mr. Millspaugh faults the Department's stormwater  guidance for its purported failure to consider the likelihood of greater storm  magnitudes in the future (see e.g. Gould Family, Millspaugh Aff, Nov. 12, 2014, P 9 [stating that the guidance is "not designed for storms  of greater intensity, storms  of greater magnitude, and storms  occurring in close proximity"]; see also Gould Family Petition at 13-15; Rainone, Millspaugh<page number="73" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> Aff, Dec. 29, 2014, P 17 [lack of analysis during severe storm  events]). The expert asserts that this deficiency is reflected in the "models and calculations" used in the draft FEIS (Gould Family, Millspaugh Aff, Nov. 12, 2014, P 10).</p><p>Neither CHA nor the Gould Family identify any legal requirement for applicant to conduct such further evaluation. Department staff  points out that "[t]here is no regulatory requirement to mitigate for storms  that exceed the 100 year storm  event" (staff,  Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014, P 30). Applicant notes that the stormwater  management plan for the modified  project has been designed in accordance with the 2010 New York State Stormwater  Management Design Manual and New York City Department of Environmental  Protection requirements (see e.g. applicant, Franke Affidavit, Nov. 17, 2014, at 17-18 [which includes meeting flood and extreme flood performance criteria]). As noted in the environmental  impact statement, stormwater  runoff  rates will not increase as a result of the project (see e.g. draft FEIS, Errata § 2.2 [Updated Stormwater  Management Design Report], at 24-27). Based on my review of the record, applicant has satisfied the applicable requirements<page number="74" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> in its mitigation  for storm  events. I concur with staff  that the issue of potential impacts from storms  of greater magnitude than the 100 year storm  event here does not present an issue that could lead to denial of the permit or imposition of significant new permit conditions (see 6 NYCRR 624.4[c][3]). Accordingly, this issue will not be adjudicated. </p><p>The Rainone petition raises additional proposed issues that concern property owned by Rainone adjacent to the proposed resort  (Rainone Petition P 3). The petition states that the Rainone property has "oft been subject to flooding and damage from snowmelt and stormwater  runoff  coming directly from the Resort  property" (id.). Rainone's specific objections relate to the purported (i) failure of applicant to consider culverts on the Rainone property that are down gradient from design points 6 and 6A, (ii) increased risk of flooding and damage occasioned by the replacement of culverts at design points 6 and 6A, and (iii) failure to consider the drainage way on the Rainone property under runoff  conditions "such as severe storm  events, events occurring in close proximity, events occurring when the ground is saturated by prior events or storm <page number="75" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> events other than Type 2 distribution" (id. P 7; Rainone, Millspaugh Aff, Dec. 29, 2014, PP 14-17). The latter issue is an offshoot of the proposed issue concerning greater storm  magnitudes which has been determined not to be substantive and significant.</p><p>The proposed issues concerning the culverts on the Rainone property and the risk of flooding in that area both relate to runoff  flows after the runoff  has left the modified  project site.  As noted by Department staff,  however, the purpose of the stormwater  management system is to ensure that stormwater  runoff  leaves the site  at the same rate as it does in the pre-development state (staff,  Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014, P 27 [citing the 2010 Design Manual]). Staff's  expert attests that the stormwater  management plan for the modified  project "has been designed in accordance with [2010 Design Manual] and [New York City Department of Environmental  Protection] requirements, including meeting Overbank Flood and Extreme Flood sizing criteria which requires post development peak discharge flow rates to be less than or equal to pre-development rates at agreed upon analysis points prior to reaching downstream properties" (staff,  Lamb-LaFay <page number="76" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, P 14; see also draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 92 [approval of analysis locations]).</p><p>Where an applicant demonstrates that its stormwater  management system will achieve runoff  rates that are at or below those under existing conditions, the applicant is not required to assess pre-existing downstream stormwater  issues, such as those noted by Rainone (see staff,  Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014, PP 27-28, Lamb-LaFay Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, P 14).</p><p>Applicant has evaluated stormwater  rates at the existing stormwater  flow rates at the existing culvert inlets, and the stormwater  model was supplemented to include a more detailed analysis of conditions along CR 49A (see draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 90-91, 94-96; 92 [approval of analysis locations]). As previously noted, applicant has agreed to undertake reconstruction of a portion of CR 49A to correct existing stormwater  capacity issues (see staff,  Ferracane Aff, Nov. 20, 2014, P 28; draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 94 [noting project plans for reconstruction of the CR 49A corridor as indicated on the General Improvement Plans]).</p><p>Although Rainone contends that the stormwater  impacts resulting from additional snow<page number="77" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> melt were not considered (Rainone Petition P 5[e]), this is addressed in the draft FEIS Responses to Comments. The response reviews the amount of snow that is melted or the rate of maximum predicted runoff  due to snowmelt during storm  events and that such an increase is minimal (see draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 108).</p><p>I have examined the studies and information and conclude that these adequately identify stormwater  flows from the modified  project and evaluate runoff  impacts (see e.g. 2013 SDEIS, Appendix 18 [Stormwater  Management Design Report]; see also id. Appendix 19 [Draft Stormwater  Pollution Prevention Plan]; draft FEIS Errata/Revisions § 2.2 [Updated Stormwater  Management Design Report]). On this record, I conclude that downstream stormwater  runoff  does not present an issue that could lead to denial of the permit or imposition of significant new permit conditions (see 6 NYCRR 624.4[c][3]). Accordingly, this issue is not substantive and significant, and will not be adjudicated. </p><p>Based on my review of the record, none of the newly  proposed stormwater-related issues raise a substantive and significant issue.</p><p>2. Galli-Curci Mansion </p><p>Petitioner PUA Associates owns the<page number="78" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> Galli-Curci Mansion  and surrounding property (PUA, Feller Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, PP 4-5). PUA proposes two issues for adjudication, both of which relate to potential impacts of the modified  project on the Galli-Curci property (id. P 15). Specifically, PUA argues that "there are substantive and significant issues with respect to visual  and noise  impacts to the Galli-Curci Estate that will be caused by construction and/or operation of the [modified]  Project" (PUA Memorandum of Law, Nov. 17, 2014, at 7). <footnote><anchor id="fnote21_179_3042_60"/><label>21</label><bodyText><p> Friends of Catskill Park indicated its concurrence with the visual  and noise  impact issues raised by PUA and included copies of the respective expert affidavits filed by PUA in relation to these proposed issues (see FCP, Feller Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, PP 12-13).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>a. Visual  Impacts</p><p>According to PUA's expert, the visual  assessment contained in the 2013 SDEIS and draft FEIS violates the Department's policy for assessing visual  impacts by failing to identify the Galli-Curci Mansion  as an aesthetic resource, and by failing to assess and mitigate visual  impacts on the mansion  (PUA, Allen Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 89).</p><p>With regard to the issue of "the inventory of aesthetic resources," <page number="79" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> the Interim Decision held that:</p><p>"[t]he record indicates that applicant undertook a substantial effort to determine what significant views would be impacted in the various categories (such as State parks, urban cultural parks, State Forest Preserve, etc.) that are set forth in the [Visual  Impacts Policy]. Applicant's inventory of aesthetic resources is sufficient and this sub-issue (including [consideration of (1) aesthetic resources of statewide concern to be included in the visual  impacts inventory; (2) selection of appropriate control points within those listed resources; (3) the significance of any visual  impacts provided by the analysis of these inputs; and (4) mitigation  measures]) shall not be adjudicated. "</p><p>(Interim Decision at 67 [citation omitted]).</p><p>Absent a material change to the potential visual  impacts on the Galli-Curci Estate that would be substantive and significant, the proposed issues raised by PUA concerning such impacts have previously been determined to be non-adjudicable under the Interim Decision. Accordingly, the first issue to consider is whether the modified  project results in changes to the potential visual  impacts on the Galli-Curci Mansion  that are<page number="80" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> significant enough to warrant revisiting the determination in the Interim Decision.</p><p>The proposed structures of concern to PUA's visual  expert are the four duplexes proposed to the south of the Galli-Curci Mansion,  and the Leach Farm Conference Center (see PUA, Allen Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, PP 18-19 [referring to the duplexes as "the nearest proposed structure within the Highmount complex"], 69-73 [discussing the expert's "preliminary" renderings of the Highmount complex from the Galli-Curci property (the renderings, which depict the four duplexes in yellow, are attached to the Allen affidavit as exhibits 7 and 8, and for the Leach Farm Conference Center as exhibit 9)]).</p><p>The plan for the Leach Farm Conference Center calls for the structure to be an "adaptive reuse" of some existing buildings as part of the Highmount development (see 2013 SDEIS at 2?3). The plan calls for certain existing buildings to be connected, creating a single building that will be used as the conference center (id.; see also id., figures 2-9, 2-10). There is no indication in the record, however, that the proposed single structure would be significantly more visible from the mansion  than the existing structures.<br/><page number="81" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/><br/>The project as proposed under the 2003 DEIS called for a 21-lot subdivision on the land that is now slated for the Highmount Hotel and detached duplex units. Under the 2003 DEIS plan, the 21 lots were to be developed as sites  for single-family homes, with three of the proposed building lots directly bordering the Galli-Curci Mansion  property (see 2003 DEIS, Master Plan, Drawing MP-3 [depicting proposed lots 1, 20 and 21 abutting three sides of the Galli-Curci Mansion  property]). Notably, the 2003 DEIS plan would have resulted in the construction of single-family homes in and around the area where the four duplexes are to be built under the modified  project (see id. [depicting proposed lots 1, 2, 8, 16 to the south of the Galli-Curci Mansion  property]; 2013 SDEIS, Project Master Plan L-1.00; Grading and Drainage Plan, Drawing L?4.01 [depicting the four duplexes to the south of the Galli-Curci Mansion  property]).</p><p>The modified  project also includes Highmount Hotel which, although further from the Galli-Curci Mansion  than the duplexes, and beyond another stand of trees, may be visible from the mansion  during leaf-off conditions. Still, the modified  project includes deciduous and evergreen<page number="82" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> tree plantings along CR 49A, to the north and south of the duplexes, that, in addition to the trees already present, will further screen both the duplexes and the hotel from the mansion  (see 2013 SDEIS, Site  Layout, Materials and Planting Plan, Drawing L-6.01).</p><p>In light of the foregoing, it appears that the visual  impacts on the Galli-Curci Mansion  under the modified  project are no more significant than the visual  impacts that would have occurred under the 2003 DEIS plan. Nevertheless, I consider the merits of PUA's argument below.</p><p>PUA's expert asserts that the Galli-Curci Estate qualifies as "an aesthetic resource of statewide significance [but] is not identified in the SDEIS as such" (PUA, Allen Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 20). The expert states that "the main house at the Galli-Curci Estate[] is just 550 feet from the Leach Conference Center and 600 feet from the nearest proposed structure within the Highmount complex" (id. P 18). The expert asserts that, "[g]iven this close proximity, direct visibility of the proposed development is likely . . . through existing deciduous trees from the entrance court at [the mansion] " (id. P 19). According to this expert, the visual  assessment <page number="83" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> contained in the 2013 SDEIS and draft FEIS "violates the DEC [Program Policy, DEP-00-2, Assessing and Mitigating Visual  Impacts ("Visual  Impacts Policy"), dated July 31, 2000] and the basic tenets of the SEQRA process with regard to the identification, assessment and mitigation  of visual  impacts" (PUA, Allen Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 89). PUA's expert opines that the modified  project "will undoubtedly alter the aesthetic quality and historic integrity of the property" (id. P 88).</p><p>Where it appears that a project under review by the Department may affect a property listed, or eligible for listing, on the State or National Register of Historic Places, staff  is required to "consult with the commissioner [of the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ("OPRHP")] concerning the impact of the project" (Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law ["PRHPL"] 14.09[1]; see also 6 NYCRR 621.3[a][8][stating that when a determination under PRHPL 14.09 is required, "the application is not complete until [OPRHP] has made a determination whether: (i) any historic, architectural, archeological or cultural resources present in the project impact area are significant (listed on or eligible<page number="84" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> for listing on the State or National Register of Historic Places); and (ii) the project may have any impacts on such significant resources"]). OPRHP is statutorily mandated to consider potential adverse impacts to historic properties, including the "introduction of visual,  audible, or atmospheric elements that are out of character with the property or alter its setting" (PRHPL 14.09[1]).</p><p>The record here demonstrates that OPRHP (i) was regularly consulted beginning early in the review process, (ii) identified the Galli-Curci Estate as eligible for listing on the State and National Register in or about 2000, and (iii) determined that the project, both as proposed under the 2003 DEIS and as modified,  "would have No Adverse Impact on the historic resources that were identified" (draft FEIS, Errata § 2.7; id., Responses to Comments at 38, 177; id., Executive Summary § 3.13; see generally 2013 SDEIS, Appendix 12 [Supplemental Cultural Resources Information]; 2003 DEIS, Appendix 23). OPRHP did not recommend any mitigation  measures (id.). Contrary to the assertions made by PUA, the Galli-Curci Estate was identified early in the process as an aesthetic resource, and impacts on the estate<page number="85" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> were appropriately considered.</p><p>Department staff's  expert notes that, consistent with the requirements of section 14.09 of the PRHPL, OPRHP was regularly consulted with regard to potential impacts of the project on historical properties (staff,  Whitehead Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, PP 30-32). Staff's  expert asserts that OPRHP was aware in 2000 that the Galli-Curci Estate (which, at that time, was referred to by OPRHP as the "Sutter Estate") was eligible for listing on National Register of Historic Places (id. P 12; see also 2003 DEIS, Appendix 6, OPRHP letter, June 12, 2000 [attached "Resource Evaluation," stating that the Sutter Estate "meet[s] the criteria for inclusion in the State and National Registers of Historic Places"]).

For a discussion of the full visual  impact assessment that applicant conducted, see 2013 SDEIS § 3.6 and Appendix 25 [Visual  Impact Assessment] in which daytime and nighttime conditions were examined and measures to mitigate visual  impacts are addressed.</p><p>As part of the draft FEIS, applicant undertook additional review of the potential visual  impacts on the Galli-Curci Estate. That analysis shows that intervening topography and vegetation will provide a visual  screen of the project. Views of the modified  project from the Galli-Curci Mansion  will be limited under both leaf-on and leaf-off conditions (see e.g. draft FEIS Executive Summary § 3.6 [analyses show that proposed hotel "will not visually impact the Galli Curci Mansion" ], Errata § 2.4). Of note is a photograph taken from an open field <page number="88" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> on the northern portion of the project site,  directly across CR 49A from the Galli-Curci Mansion,  and looking north toward the mansion.  This photograph depicts only trees that are located on the Galli-Curci property and, therefore, none of applicant's activities will remove the trees shown. The photograph shows that existing vegetation on the Galli-Curci property provides a significant visual  screen (draft FEIS, Errata § 2.4, Photo # 3119; see also PUA, Allen Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, Exh 5 [photograph taken from the Galli-Curci property looking south toward the project site] ). Additionally, as noted, the modified  project provides for deciduous and evergreen tree plantings along CR 49A that will provide additional visual  screening of the project.</p><p>I conclude that PUA has failed to raise an adjudicable  issue concerning the sufficiency of applicant's visual  analysis or the ability of the Department to make the required SEQRA findings based on that analysis (see 6 NYCRR 624.4[c][6][i][<emphasis typeStyle="it">b</emphasis>]). Accordingly, issues concerning the visual  impacts on the Galli-Curci property will not be adjudicated. </p><p>b. Noise  Impacts</p><p>PUA proposes the issue of excessive noise  impacts to the Galli-Curci property<page number="89" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> (PUA, Feller Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P15).</p><p>With regard to operational noise,  the Interim Decision held that "only the issue of operational noise  impacts on users of wilderness and wild forest areas of the Catskill Forest Preserve (in close proximity to the project) arising from onsite activities shall be adjudicated"  (id. at 59). However, the Interim Decision also notes that the assessment of operational noise  requires further study (id. at 57 [stating that "applicant should undertake a noise  study that would take into account the onsite noise-generating activities that would occur at [the resort] "). Given this, I deem it appropriate to consider PUA's argument in the context of operational noise  impacts.</p><p>With regard to construction noise,  the issue of construction noise  impacts was determined to be non-adjudicable under the Interim Decision. Specifically, the Deputy Commissioner held that, "I concur with the ALJ that applicant's Community Sound Survey and Construction Noise  Impact Assessment is of sufficient scope and detail with respect to construction noise  issues" (Interim Decision at 58 [citation omitted]). The Interim Decision concludes that "[a]pplicant has addressed concerns<page number="90" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> regarding construction noise  and has proposed mitigation  measures" (id. at 58). Notwithstanding the holding of the Interim Decision, PUA does not attempt to establish that construction noise  impacts on the Galli-Curci Mansion  will be more significant under the modified  project than they would have been under the 2003 DEIS plan. This alone makes its offer of proof insufficient. Nevertheless, I will consider the merits of PUA's argument as to construction noise  impacts as well.</p><p>PUA's argument focuses, in large part, on whether the mansion  was appropriately considered as a noise  receptor, without regard to whether the noise  is generated by construction or by operations (see PUA, Millspaugh Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, PP 13-23).</p><p>As noted, PUA questions the adequacy of the noise  analysis in relation to the Galli-Curci Mansion,  but does not provide a basis to conclude that construction noise  from the modified  project will be materially different from construction noise  under the project as proposed under the 2003 DEIS. Both plans require construction of an access road to the south of the mansion  on the south side of CR 49A (the intersection of the access road and CR 49A was to be closer to <page number="91" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> the mansion  under the 2003 DEIS plan) and both plans entail construction of structures, either duplexes or single family homes, along the access road (see 2003 DEIS, Master Plan, Drawing MP-3; 2013 SDEIS, Site  Layout, Materials and Planting Plan, Drawing L-6.01).</p><p>PUA argues that "[t]he noise  impacts that have been analyzed in the DEIS do not provide information which is specific to the Galli-Curci Mansion"  (PUA Memorandum of Law, Nov. 17, 2014, at 6-7). According to PUA, this raises questions regarding "the adequacy of the DEIS and whether DEC can make the required findings under SEQRA and whether the requirements for mitigation  under [PRHPL] have been satisfied" (id. at 6). PUA's expert states that various noise  studies undertaken in relation to the modified  project "do not provide any specific evaluation of the potential noise  impacts to the [Galli-Curci] Mansion"  (PUA, Millspaugh Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 13).</p><p>Contrary to PUA's and its expert's contentions, Department staff  notes that the Galli-Curci Mansion  was considered as a noise  receptor (staff  Reply Memorandum of Law, Dec. 8, 2014, at 23). The noise  assessment included in the 2003 DEIS expressly addressed noise  impacts on <page number="92" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> the mansion  from construction of the "Highmount Estates Lodging  Units" (i.e., the 21-lot residential subdivision) and the associated access road (see 2003 DEIS, Appendix 22 at 5-2 to 5-4 [identifying "W-2" (the Galli-Curci Mansion)  as the nearest receptor to construction on lots 1, 16 and 20]). Similarly, the noise  assessment in the 2013 SDEIS, which "supplements the original Project noise  assessment conducted for the [2003] DEIS" (2013 SDEIS, Appendix 20 [Construction and Operations Noise  Study] at iii), again shows that noise  impacts on the mansion  from both construction and operation were considered and analyzed (see id. at 3 [identifying receptor "W-2" and others as "residences on CR 49A"], figure 2-1 [map depicting location of receptors, including receptor W-2 at the location of the mansion] , tables [listing W-2 as a receptor and indicating the relevant noise  impacts]). The analysis shows that the noise  impacts on the mansion  will be minimal (see SDEIS, Appendix 20; see also draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 180-182 [discussing the noise  study, referencing in part evaluations as to receptor W-2 (Galli-Curci Mansion) ]).</p><p>Based on the record before me, PUA has failed to raise<page number="93" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> an adjudicable  issue concerning the sufficiency of applicant's noise  assessment or the ability of the Department to make the required SEQRA findings based on that assessment (see 6 NYCRR 624.4[c][6][i][<emphasis typeStyle="it">b]</emphasis>). Accordingly, this issue will not be adjudicated. </p><p>3. Air Quality  Impacts</p><p>Under the heading "modifications  to the project have created additional substantive and significant issues for adjudication," CHA contends that the project will have "unmitigated adverse impacts on air quality,  public health, and traffic in the vicinity of the project" (CHA, Caffry Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 62 [capitalization of heading deleted]). CHA argues that the 2013 SDEIS "did not properly assess air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from vehicles . . . which could result in violations of ambient air quality  standards" (CHA, Caffry Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, at 33). CHA's proffered expert (Zamurs and Associates, Inc. ["Zamurs"]) opines that vehicle emissions from project-related traffic "could result in significant exposure to air pollution, and resulting health effects, to the visitors and employees to the Belleayre Resort  and Ski Center" (CHA, Exh D [Zamurs Comment], Nov. 14, 2014, at 2). This expert<page number="94" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> also opines that such emissions could cause violations of air quality  standards.</p><p>As reflected in the Issues Ruling, the traffic issues that were the focus of the issues conference concerned the potential for noise  impacts and increased traffic volume (see id. at 95?100). Notably, at the time of the issues conference, CHA did not pursue the issue of traffic-related air quality  impacts. This is despite the fact that the proposed project  under the 2003 DEIS was considerably larger and would have accommodated more visitors and, as a result, more vehicles. Nevertheless, counsel for CHA makes no argument regarding his conclusion that modifications  to the project have created this newly  proposed issue (see CHA, Caffry Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, at 32-34).</p><p>Accordingly, this proposed issue is rejected as untimely.</p><p>Even if it were timely raised, CHA's arguments are unpersuasive and do not support identifying this as an adjudicable  issue. Department staff's  reply papers, which include the affidavit of Michael Sheehan, Chief of the DEC's Mobile Source and Climate Planning Section, fully rebut the comments of CHA's expert. <footnote><anchor id="fnote23_212_3668_172"/><label>23</label><bodyText><p> For the analysis performed for project-related traffic, see the Air Quality  Assessment in the 2013 SDEIS in Appendix 24.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="95" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Department staff's  expert notes that applicant's Air Quality  Assessment follows the procedures set forth in the New York State Department of Transportation Air Quality  Analysis Procedure: project Environmental  Guidelines, as identified in the final scoping document (staff,  Sheehan Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, P 6). The studies and analyses on air quality  impacts (see e.g. 2013 SDEIS at 3-87 to 3-89; 2013 Appendix 24 [Air Quality  Study]) show that applicant has sufficiently evaluated air quality  impacts for the modified  project. <footnote><anchor id="fnote24_214_3719_13"/><label>24</label><bodyText><p> Attached to CHA's December 29, 2014 response to FCP's motion to strike portions of Department staff's  December 8, 2014 reply papers was an additional response of Zamurs and Associates, Inc. to the December 8, 2014 affidavit of Department staff  witness Michael Sheehan. The additional response was beyond the scope of the motion to strike, and is rejected. Even if considered, the additional response would not alter my determination that CHA has failed to raise an adjudicable  issue.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="96" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/><br/>I note that CHA's expert suggests that the air quality  analysis for the project should be updated to reflect recent changes to air quality  standards or modeling procedures. The expert states that the air quality  analysis should be redone using "the latest USEPA emission model, MOVES (MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator) . . . released [in] 2010" (CHA, Zamurs Comment, Nov. 14, 2014, at 2). The expert also asserts that staff  improperly declined to update the air quality  analysis included in the 2013 SDEIS, in part, on the basis that fewer than three years would pass between the date of the 2013 SDEIS and issuance  of the FEIS (id. at 2). Although the expert acknowledges that the three year "shelf-life" for air analyses is used by the Federal Highway Administration, he quotes from an abstract contained in the New York State Department of Transportation Environmental  Procedures Manual ("DOT Manual") to argue that because the project's air quality  assessment was completed in February 2011, it must be redone (id. at 3).</p><p>CHA's arguments with respect to the modeling and the timing of the analysis are rejected. The expert relies upon language contained in the 2001 abstract for the air quality <page number="97" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> chapter of the DOT Manual, both of which were written in January 2001 <footnote><anchor id="fnote25_217_3768_243"/><label>25</label><bodyText><p> Note that, although the chapter on air quality  in the DOT Manual was written in 2001, section 8 of the chapter, entitled "Air Quality  Models," was updated in December 2012.</p></bodyText></footnote> (DOT Manual, Chapter 1.1 at 6). The 2001 abstract states that the new procedures contained in the chapter supersede what had previously been contained in "all previous air quality  Project Environmental  Guidelines (PEGs), Interim Project Development Guidelines (IPDGs), guidance memos, etc." (id.). The 2001 abstract does not state that MOVES, an air emissions model that was released nearly a decade after the abstract was written, must be used.</p><p>Furthermore, the expert's comment omits part of the quoted text from the abstract. Using the abstract for authority, the expert states that "more than three years has elapsed [since the air quality  assessment for the project was completed] and a re-analysis is required" (CHA, Zamurs Comment, Nov. 14, 2014, at 3). The abstract, however, states that re-analysis is required only "for projects in carbon monoxide nonattainment and maintenance areas" that lack a "conformity determination" (DOT Manual, <page number="98" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> Chapter 1.1 at 6). The modified  project, however, is not located in a carbon monoxide nonattainment area (2013 SDEIS, Appendix 24 [Air Quality  Assessment] at 1). As staff  points out, the main text of the air quality  chapter states that use of the MOVES model is required only for "quantitative project level microscale/hot-spot analyses in carbon monoxide [CO] and particulate matter [PM] nonattainment and maintenance areas beginning on or after December 20, 2012" (staff,  Sheehan Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, P 6; see also draft FEIS at 155-56; DOT Manual, Chapter 1.1 at 1.1-17).</p><p>As noted, Department staff  have indicated that the modeling used for the modified  project was appropriate and in compliance with the DOT Manual (see e.g. staff,  Sheehan Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, PP 10-11; see also draft FEIS at 155-56 [noting that use of the MOVES model is not required where, as here, certain conditions set forth in the DOT Manual are met]). As noted in the draft FEIS, the air quality  analysis, contrary to CHA expert's comments, remains timely (see draft FEIS at 156).</p><p>CHA's expert also speculates that, "if a thorough and technically sound air quality  analysis were to be performed . . . the project would likely<page number="99" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> demonstrate a violation or exacerbation of a violation of one or more ambient air quality  standards" (CHA, Zamurs Comment, Nov. 14, 2014, at 4). Given the complexity and variables of the MOVES model, Department staff's  expert questions "how the commentator could make these conclusions without first completing a full analysis of the project using the MOVES model" (staff,  Sheehan Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, P13; see also id. PP 14-16). Department staff  provides further evaluation that supports the determination that the modified  project would not violate or exacerbate a violation of ambient air quality  standards (see e.g. staff,  Sheehan Aff, Dec. 8, 2014, PP 17-18, 30, 32-35). The speculative or conclusory statements of CHA's expert would be insufficient to raise an adjudicable  issue, even if timely raised. <footnote><anchor id="fnote26_221_3853_34"/><label>26</label><bodyText><p> Certain of the comments of CHA's expert relate to the Belleayre Mountain Ski Center Unit Management Plan which, as previously noted, is not part of this proceeding.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>4.

ENV LEXIS 29"/><br/>I have considered CHA's comments and find that none raise a substantive and significant issue. As Department staff  points out, the comments of CHA's expert "have already been addressed by staff  in the FEIS Responses to Comments" (staff  Reply Memorandum of Law, Dec. 8, 2014, at 20). Section 3.2 of the draft FEIS Responses to Comments provides a detailed review of groundwater and surface water input to local streams,  including Emory Brook (see draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 128-29). A water budget analysis (see 2013 SDEIS Appendix 22 [Water Budget Analysis]) has been conducted for the modified  project to evaluate the change in runoff  and recharge on an annualized basis. The analysis indicated a potential for only a "very slight decrease" in aquifer recharge and "a negligible increase" in runoff  (see 2013 SDEIS Appendix 22 at 11).</p><p>The draft FEIS responses to comments notes that the affected drainage basin, the Bush Kill basin, covers an area of approximately 47 square miles and that the average flow of the Bush Kill at the nearest downstream USGS gaging station (approximately one mile east of Arkville) is 44,838 gpm. Given the foregoing, the responses to comments notes that <page number="102" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> "[e]ven if it is assumed that 100% of the potential 19 gpm decrease in aquifer recharge [caused by the increase in impervious surfaces] would result in an equivalent and direct loss to local stream  flows, the resultant change in stream  flow and temperature would be unnoticeable" (draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 129).</p><p>The environmental  impact statement addresses issues that were raised in regards to trout and trout habitat, including how the potential for thermal impacts has been addressed (see e.g. 2013 SDEIS at 3-7 [addressing thermal loadings]; id.

ENV LEXIS 29"/> at 1). Chief among these other factors, according to the expert, is the loss of an estimated 182 gpm <footnote><anchor id="fnote29_230_3951_191"/><label>29</label><bodyText><p> The estimated withdrawal rate used by CHA's expert is based upon the maximum daily demand, which assumes full build out of the modified  project, 100% occupancy, and a "peaking factor" (multiplier) of 1.65, for a maximum demand of 262,000 gallons per day ("gpd") (see 2013 SDEIS, Appendix 13 at 2). The Water System Preliminary Design Report states that demand on an "average day," using the assumption of 70% occupancy, would be approximately 111,000 gpd, before applying the peaking factor (id.). Applying the peaking factor to the 111,000 gpd estimate and converting the estimate to gpm results in an estimated demand on an average day of under 130 gpm.</p></bodyText></footnote>) that is to be drawn from on-site wells for the project's potable water supply (id.).</p><p>CHA's comments on the potential stream  impacts associated with the project's potable water supplies are not supported. The water supply to meet design demand will be provided by two well fields identified as the K and Q well fields (see 2013 SDEIS, Appendix 13 [Water System Preliminary Design Report] at 4). The well pumping tests for the <page number="104" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> potable water supply wells indicate that the modified  project will have little or no impact on surface water flows. During the pumping tests, water levels of streams  and brooks in the vicinity of the well sites  were measured from one to three times a day before, during, and after each well pumping test. As set forth in the report on the pumping tests, the stream  water level data collected during the pumping tests show "no impact" to the streams  from pumping (2013 SDEIS, Appendix 13, Appendix E [Well Field Hydrology Report] at 23 [K wells], 45 [Q well], tables 8, 9, 10, 35; see also 2013 SDEIS at 3-18). Moreover, given that the average flow of the Bush Kill downstream from the well sites  is 44,838 gpm, significant impacts on the Bush Kill, even at the maximum estimated rate of 182 gpm, have not been shown to occur.</p><p>CHA's expert asserts that applicant's well pumping tests were not done in conformance with established Department procedure (CHA, Michalski Comment, Nov. 2014, at 3-4). Contrary to this assertion, however, the well test protocols were thoroughly vetted and approved by both Department staff  and the New York State Department of Health ("NYSDOH") (see 2013 SDEIS, Appendix <page number="105" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> 13, Appendix E at 2, 28 [stating that the pumping tests for the K wells and the Q well were submitted to, and approved by, the Department and NYSDOH]; draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 58). As reflected in the 2013 SDEIS, and the draft FEIS, Department staff  and NYSDOH were integrally involved with the development, implementation, and review of the pumping tests. Therefore, the assertion of CHA's expert is in error.</p><p>Regarding the contention of CHA's expert regarding impacts to wetlands, I note that staff  has determined that wetlands will continue to respond to seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation with no impact due to pumping of the K or Q wells (see staff  Reply Memorandum of Law at 21). Potential wetland impacts were adequately addressed in the environmental  impact statement documents, noting, in particular, that nothing demonstrates that the local wetlands would "dry up" and noting that the wetlands on the site  "are formed in areas where water emerges onto the surface because clayey soil or the lack of fractures in the rock prevents water from percolating downward" (see e.g. draft FEIS, Responses to Comments at 132).</p><p>Finally CHA's arguments regarding road salting<page number="106" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> impacts are speculative and are insufficient to raise an adjudicable  issue.</p><p>I conclude that the comments proffered by CHA on groundwater and surface water quality and quantity, and fish populations, do not raise any substantive and significant issue that warrants adjudication.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">E. Comments of CCCD and NRDC</emphasis></p><p>As previously noted, both CCCD and NRDC raised concerns relating to the cancelling of the adjudicatory hearing.  These are addressed below.</p><p>1. CCCD</p><p>CCCD, in discussing the status of the independent stormwater  monitor, referenced an apparent discrepancy between the draft SPDES permit and the language in the AIP regarding the monitor. Applicant has agreed that the language developed in the AIP for the independent stormwater  monitor should be included as a special condition to the SPDES permit and has so recommended to the Department (see applicant, Ruzow Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, at P 59; see also letter dated April 5, 2013 from Daniel A. Ruzow, Esq., to DEC Regional Permit Administrator Daniel T. Whitehead). I concur that the provision for an independent stormwater  monitor reflecting the commitments made in the AIP should be included either in the SPDES permit for the project or<page number="107" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> other enforceable DEC instrument and hereby direct Department staff  to do so. However, Department staff  must ensure that any reporting times or other related requirements in that provision are consistent with Department legal guidance and procedural requirements.</p><p>CCCD requested an independent, comprehensive study of the future lodging  needs of the Catskill Mountains and the integration of new investments with the existing resources of the area. CCCD, however, did not identify any statutory or regulatory provision that would require such a study to be undertaken in this matter. I see no legal basis or justification for that request here. As to CCCD's comments regarding the timing of the filing of deed restrictions concerning Class III gaming and density restrictions for the modified  project, applicant has expressed its commitment to record such deed restrictions in accordance with the AIP. Applicant proposes to put those deed restrictions in place following issuance  of all "final, non-appealable approvals" for the resort  (which commitment is also reflected in the draft FEIS [see draft FEIS, Section 2.0, at 41) (see applicant, Ruzow Aff, Nov. 17, 2014, P 61; staff  Reply Memorandum<page number="108" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> of Law, Dec. 8, 2014, at 5 n 2 [deed restrictions in AIP on gaming not relevant to Department's review]). CCCD's concerns do not raise an adjudicable  issue nor do they support denying staff's  motion.</p><p>2. NRDC</p><p>As previously mentioned, NRDC objected to the cancelling of the administrative proceeding until final deed restriction language that forecloses the option of casino gambling on the site  and final arrangements for adding such language to the deeds have been agreed to by the developers and the parties, and final deed restriction language on density limitations and final arrangements for adding such language to the deeds have been agreed to by the developers and the parties. As discussed above in the context of CCCD's comments, applicant has expressed its commitment to record gaming and density limitation restrictions in accordance with the AIP. Applicant proposes to put those deed restrictions in place following issuance  of all "final, non-appealable approvals" for the resort.  NRDC's concern does not raise an adjudicable  issue and its objection is rejected.</p><p>NRDC also objected to the cancelling of the administrative proceeding until applicant reaffirmed its commitment to manage<page number="109" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> the golf course  as organic and to establish a technical review committee are incorporated into the applicable SPDES permit. No adjudicable  issue has been raised and based on the following discussion, the objection is rejected. I note that, with respect to the golf course,  applicant has developed an organic turfgrass management plan pursuant to Section 19 of the AIP. This plan is contained in the 2013 SDEIS (see 2013 SDEIS at 2-22 and 2013 SDEIS Appendix 15 [Organic Golf Course  Management Plan]). Applicant has also submitted golf course   mitigation  conditions to the Department (see letter dated April 5, 2013 from Daniel A. Ruzow, Esq. to DEC Regional Permit Administrator Daniel T. Whitehead). The AIP, which both applicant and NRDC, among other parties, have signed, provides for the establishment of a Technical Review Committee (which membership includes a representative from DEC, NYC DEP, the golf course  superintendent, Crossroads Ventures, LLC, and a non-governmental organization). Applicant has set forth conditions relating to the golf course  operation in its April 5, 2013 letter, and I direct staff  to include these conditions, as well as to the establishment of the Technical Review<page number="110" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 29"/> Committee, in the SEQRA findings statement and, as appropriate, into any Department permits or other approvals. Furthermore, all updates with respect to the Organic Golf Course  Management Plan are to be provided, in addition to the Technical Committee, to the DEC Regional Directors in Regions 3 and 4.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">F. Motion to Deny the 2007 Motion for Reconsideration</emphasis></p><p>Department staff  also requests denial of the outstanding motion for reconsideration of the Interim Decision ruling which denied adjudication of the community character issue. The motion for reconsideration was filed by Catskill Park Coalition on January 29, 2007. By ruling dated November 9, 2007, former Commissioner Alexander B.

As noted in the Interim Decision, adopted local land use plans are afforded significant deference by the Department in ascertaining the character of a community. Accordingly, the Department relies "to a large extent" on local land use plans as the standard for community character (Interim Decision at 71-72). Importantly, the Interim Decision held that the record of this proceeding already includes sufficient information on community character for the purposes of the Department's SEQRA review (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="2014 P. 36,at 73"><content>id. at 73 n 21</content></citation> [listing, among other things, three days of discussion of the community character issue during the issues conference]). <footnote><anchor id="fnote30_247_4152_125"/><label>30</label><bodyText><p> The record has been further supplemented by the submissions that have been filed on Department staff's  motion and in the environmental  impact statement documents.

McClymonds, Chief Administrative Law Judge</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">RULING OF THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON MOTIONS</emphasis></h><p>In this administrative enforcement proceeding,  Department staff  charges respondent Alan Grout with disturbing a protected stream  without a permit on property owned by respondent in Valatie, Town of Kinderhook, Columbia County. The parties have filed various pre-hearing motions addressed to the pleadings including respondent's motion to dismiss  the complaint, and Department staff's   motion to strike   affirmative defense.  This ruling addresses the parties' various motions and requests.</p><p>I. PROCEEDINGS</p><p>Department staff  commenced this administrative enforcement proceeding  by service of a notice  of hearing and complaint dated May 5, 2014 (see Affirmation  of Karen Lavery in Support of Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses [6-13-14], Attachment 2). Respondent Alan Grout, among other things, served an answer dated June 6, 2014 (see id., Attachment<page number="2" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> 3). In the June 6, 2014 answer, respondent pleaded  as his fifth affirmative defense  that the complaint was not properly served on respondent (see id. at 8).</p><p>On June 13, 2014, Department staff  filed a notice of motion  and motion to strike  affirmative defenses, with supporting documents. On June 23, 2014, respondent filed a notice of motion  to dismiss the complaint and an attorney's affirmation  in opposition to the Department's motion to strike  and in support of respondent's motion to dismiss  (see Affirmation  of Meave M. Tooher [6-23-14]).</p><p>On the request of Department staff,  the undersigned Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) convened a telephone conference call with the parties on June 24, 2014, to discuss procedural issues raised by staff.  Thereafter, by letter dated June 25, 2014, Department staff  notified respondent and the ALJ that it was withdrawing the complaint against respondent, and that the complaint would be re-served on respondent to correct any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction over respondent (see Letter from Karen Lavery to ALJ McClymonds [6-25-14]).</p><p>Department staff  mailed a notice  of hearing and complaint dated June 25, 2014, to respondent by certified mail. The complaint<page number="3" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> was received by respondent on June 28, 2014, thereby completing service (see 6 NYCRR 622.3[a][3]; see also Affirmation  of Karen Lavery in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss [7-15-14], Attachment 1; Affirmation  of Meave M. Tooher in Support of Respondent's Motion to Dismiss [7-7-14] [Tooher Affirmation  (7-7-14)], P 2). In the complaint, Department staff  alleges that respondent violated 6 NYCRR 608.2(a) by burying a protected stream  -- identified as "Stuyvesant Creek," a Class C(T) stream  -- within a pipe running about 500 feet without a permit on property owned by respondent on Fordham Road, Valatie, Columbia County, New York. Staff  seeks a civil penalty in the amount of $ 1,200, and the submission of a plan to restore the stream  to its natural condition.</p><p>On July 7, 2014, respondent served a revised answer of the same date on Department staff  (see Tooher Affirmation  [7-7-14], Exhibit B). In his July 7, 2014 answer, respondent pleaded  four affirmative defenses (see id.).</p><p>Also on July 7, 2014, respondent filed a notice of motion  to dismiss the June 25, 2014, complaint, together with an attorney's affirmation  and exhibits, and an affidavit of respondent Alan J. Grout in support of the motion<page number="4" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> to dismiss.</p><p>On July 15, 2014, Department staff  filed papers in opposition to respondent's motion, <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_18_208_61"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> Department staff  denominated its papers in opposition to respondent's motion to dismiss  as a "Notice of Motion"  and "Motion in Opposition to Respondent's Motion to Dismiss." Department staff  is authorized by regulation  to file papers in response to a motion by a respondent (see 6 NYCRR 622.6[c][3]). A motion is not necessary to file papers in response to a motion and, accordingly, I do not treat staff's  "motion in opposition" to respondent's motion to dismiss  as a separate affirmative motion.</p></bodyText></footnote> and a notice of motion  and motion for permission to amend  the complaint and to strike affirmative defenses. Staff  also filed an attorney's affirmation  in opposition to respondent's motion to dismiss,  in support of its motion to strike  affirmative defenses, and for permission to amend  the complaint (see Affirmation  of Karen Lavery [7-15-14]). Attached to the attorney's affirmation  is a proposed amended complaint dated July 15, 2014 (see id., Attachment 3).</p><p>Respondent thereafter filed an attorney's affirmation  dated July 22, 2014, in opposition to Department staff's   motion to strike  affirmative<page number="5" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> defenses and in response to the motion to amend  the complaint (see Affirmation  of Meave M. Tooher [7-22-14]).</p><p>On July 28, 2014, Department staff  filed a further attorney's affirmation  in opposition to respondent's opposition to the Department's motion to strike  affirmative defenses and in response to the motion to amend  the complaint (see Affirmation  of Karen Lavery [7-28-14]). By letter dated July 29, 2014, respondent objects to staff's  July 28, 2014 submission as a further responsive pleading not authorized by the ALJ pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.6(c)(3). Accordingly, respondent requests that the July 28, 2014 affirmation  be struck.</p><p>II. DISCUSSION</p><p>A. Request To Strike Department Staff's  July 28, 2014 Submission</p><p>Respondent is correct that Department staff's  July 28, 2014 submission is in the nature of a reply on staff's   motion to amend  the complaint and to strike affirmative defenses. As such, filing of the reply requires leave of the ALJ (see 6 NYCRR 622.6[c][3]). Staff  did not seek leave to file the July 28, 2014 affirmation  prior to submission, nor has staff  opposed respondent's request to strike the affirmation.  Accordingly, respondent's request to strike the July 28, 2014 affirmation <page number="6" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> is granted and the affirmation  will not be considered on these motions.</p><p>B. Department Staff's  Motion to Amend  the Complaint</p><p>In support of his motion to dismiss  the June 25, 2014 complaint, respondent argues, among other things, that Department staff  fails to properly identify the alleged protected stream  in this matter. Respondent notes that the complaint alleges that the stream  at issue is "Stuyvesant Creek" (see Complaint [6-25-14] PP 9-11). Respondent further notes that no Stuyvesant Creek is identified in 6 NYCRR 836.6, Table I. Respondent does recognize, however, that "[t]here is a stream  on the property in question (the "Property") which is identified in the regulations  as Stuyvesant Brook" (Tooher Affirmation  [7-7-14] at 2, P 7).</p><p>In its July 15, 2014 motion, Department staff  requests leave to amend  the complaint pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.5(b) to correct two clerical errors: first, to correctly identify the stream  at issue as "Stuyvesant Brook," not "Stuyvesant Creek;" and second, to correctly allege the stream's   identification number  as "H-209-1," not "H-204-1" (see Complaint [6-25-14] P 9). Citing CPLR 3025(b), Department staff  argues that leave to amend  should be freely granted, <page number="7" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> provided respondent suffers no prejudice. Department staff  asserts that respondent will suffer no prejudice if these two corrections  are made. Attached to staff's  papers is a proposed amended complaint in which the two corrections  are made.</p><p>In response to staff's   motion to amend,  respondent asserts that the errors were identified by respondent in its first answer, and that staff  failed to correct the errors when it withdrew and re-served the complaint. The prejudice respondent claims is the additional cost and expense in reviewing and responding to a third complaint.</p><p>Section 622.5(b) of 6 NYCRR provides that "[c]onsistent with the CPLR a party may amend  its pleading at any time prior to the final decision of the commissioner by permission of the ALJ or the commissioner and absent prejudice to the ability of any other party to respond." CPLR 3025(b) provides that "[a] party may amend  his or her pleading, or supplement it by setting forth additional or subsequent transactions or occurrences, at any time by leave of court . . . . Leave shall be freely given upon such terms as may be just."</p><p>Where typographical errors in pleadings are involved, the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services<page number="8" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

Under CPLR 2001, a tribunal "may permit a mistake, omission, defect or irregularity . . . to be corrected, upon terms as may be just, or, if a substantial right of a party is not prejudiced,  the mistake, omission, defect or irregularity shall be disregarded." Correction  of a pleading does not necessarily require amendment of that pleading, but amendment pursuant to CPLR 3025 may be permitted if necessary (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="79 A.D.2d 361,at 365"><content>Pinto v House, <span normalizedCite="79 A.D.2d 361">79 AD2d 361<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000079#000361#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="79 A.D.2d 361">365<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000079#000361#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1st Dept 1981]).</p><p>Here, I conclude that Department staff  should be permitted to correct the two clerical errors in the June 25, 2014 complaint. Examination of the regulations  and maps incorporated in those regulations  reveals that the only protected stream  crossing Fordham Road in the vicinity of respondent's property is denominated "Stuyvesant Brook," a Class C(T) stream  with stream   identification number  H-209-1 (see 6 NYCRR 863.6 Table I, Item No. 531; 6 NYCRR 863.9 Quadrangle Maps, Map L-25NW [Kinderhook]). Thus, staff's  clerical errors<page number="9" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> are apparent from the regulations.  Moreover, respondent recognized the errors and was fairly apprised concerning correct designation of the stream  at issue in this proceeding. Thus, respondent will not be prejudiced  if the correction  is allowed.</p><p>Accordingly, staff's  motion should be granted in part, and the June 25, 2014 complaint is hereby corrected to identify the subject stream  as "Stuyvesant Brook" with stream   identification number  H-209-1. Staff's   motion to amend  the complaint is otherwise denied as unnecessary. Service and filing of a third amended complaint and answer is not necessary at this time.</p><p>C. Respondent's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint</p><p>1. Sufficiency of Complaint</p><p>Respondent moves to dismiss the complaint on multiple grounds. First, respondent argues that Department staff  failed to plead facts with sufficient particularity to establish the violation alleged in the complaint and place respondent on notice.  Specifically, respondent argues that Department staff  failed to adequately identify the property at issue, the nature of the alleged violation, and the activity requiring the alleged permit. Respondent also asserts that staff  failed to adequately specify the alleged<page number="10" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/>  stream,  its mean high water mark, and the location of its bed  or banks.</p><p>In response, Department staff  asserts that its complaint sets forth the necessary elements of proof to show a violation of 6 NYCRR 608.2(a).</p><p>In a Part 622 proceeding, motions to dismiss  a complaint are analyzed applying the grounds for and standards governing CPLR 3211 motions (see e.g. Matter of Estate of Ryan, Ruling of the Chief ALJ on Motion to Dismiss, Oct. 15, 2010, at 11). Where a motion to dismiss  is addressed to the sufficiency of the pleading, the standards governing motions to dismiss  for failure to state a claim under CPLR 3211(a)(7) are applied (see id.). To determine whether a complaint states a claim, the pleading is liberally construed, the facts alleged in the complaint are accepted as true, the proponent of the complaint is given the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and the complaint is examined to determine whether the facts as alleged fall within any cognizable legal theory (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="5 N.Y.3d 582,at 591"><content>AG Capital Funding Partners, L.P. v State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., <span normalizedCite="5 N.Y.3d 582">5 NY3d 582<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34042#3#000005#000582#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="5 N.Y.3d 582">591<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34042#3#000005#000582#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2005]; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="84 N.Y.2d 83,at 87"><content>Leon v Martinez, <span normalizedCite="84 N.Y.2d 83">84 NY2d 83<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000084#000083#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="84 N.Y.2d 83">87-88<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000084#000083#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1994]).</p><p>With respect to<page number="11" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> the notice  provided by the complaint, the Department is required by statute and regulation  to provide "reasonable" notice  of the charges involved in the proceeding, including, among other things, a statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the proceeding is to be held, a reference to the particular sections of the statutes, rules, and regulations  involved, and a concise statement of the matters asserted (see State Administrative Procedure Act § 301[2]; 6 NYCRR 622.3[a]). In the administrative context, a complaint is sufficient if it is reasonably specific, in light of all the relevant circumstances, to apprise the party whose rights are being determined of the charges against that party and to allow for the preparation of an adequate defense (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="91 N.Y.2d 133,at 139"><content>Matter of Board of Educ. v Commissioner of Educ., <span normalizedCite="91 N.Y.2d 133">91 NY2d 133<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000091#000133#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="91 N.Y.2d 133">139-140<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000091#000133#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1997]; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="73 N.Y.2d 323,at 332"><content>Matter of Block v Ambach, <span normalizedCite="73 N.Y.2d 323">73 NY2d 323<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000073#000323#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="73 N.Y.2d 323">332<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000073#000323#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1989]; see also 6 NYCRR 622.3[a][1]).</p><p>Here, a fair reading of the June 25, 2014 complaint reveals that it contains all of the elements required by SAPA and section 622.3(a), and is sufficiently specific to apprise respondent of the charges against<page number="12" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> him. The complaint states the relevant regulatory provisions alleged to have been violated and describes the alleged violation with sufficient particularity to allow respondent to prepare a defense. Specifically, the complaint alleges that a protected stream,  the Stuyvesant Brook, is located on property owned by respondent on Fordham Road, Valatie, Columbia County, and that respondent disturbed the stream  by burying it in a pipe for approximately 500 feet on the site without a permit. Moreover, review of respondent's submissions on the motion reveal that respondent is aware of the property and stream  at issue, and understands the nature of charges against him sufficiently to allow him to prepare a defense. Thus, the complaint fairly states a claim for a violation of 6 NYCRR 608.2(a).</p><p>2. Failure to Name Necessary Party </p><p>Second, respondent moves to dismiss the complaint on the ground that Department staff  failed to name Golden Harvest Farms, Inc., as a necessary party.  In his answer, respondent asserts that Golden Harvest is the operator of the subject property, which is currently used as part of an orchard,  and is responsible for any and all activities on all orchard  property (see Answer<page number="13" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> P 2). Respondent further asserts that the actions of respondent Grout at or in relation to the property were in his capacity as president and corporate officer of Golden Harvest (see id. PP 2, 71). Thus, on his motion and as the fourth affirmative defense   pleaded  in the answer, respondent argues the complaint must be dismissed for failure to name Golden Harvest as a necessary party. </p><p>In response, and in support of its motion to strike  the fourth affirmative defense,  Department staff  notes that respondent has admitted that he is the owner of the property at issue, and that staff  has exercised the prosecutorial discretion to charge respondent as the property owner.</p><p>In response to staff's   motion to strike,  respondent again asserts that Golden Harvest is the operator of the farm on the property, but does not further elaborate as to why Golden Harvest is a necessary party. </p><p>A complaint may be dismissed without prejudice upon the ground that the tribunal should not proceed in the absence of a person who should be a party (see CPLR 3211[a][10]; see also CPLR 1003). Pursuant to CPLR 1001(a), a non-party is considered to be a necessary party  if (1) complete relief cannot be accorded between <page number="14" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> the parties to the action without the nonparty, or (2) the nonparty might be inequitably affected by a judgment (see also Matter of Karta Corp., ALJ Ruling on Motion to Join Third-Party Respondent, Dec. 8, 2008, at 4). Even assuming a nonparty is a necessary party  under CPLR 1001(a), a tribunal may allow an action to proceed without that party under the provisions of CPLR 1001(b) (see CPLR 1003; see also Matter of Karta Corp., ALJ Ruling at 4-5). Among the factors considered when determining whether an action may proceed in the absence of a necessary party  are (1) the prejudice that may accrue from the nonjoinder to the defendant or the non-party, and (2) whether an effective judgment may be rendered in the absence of the person who is not joined (see CPLR 1001[b]).</p><p>Here, respondent has not established that Golden Harvest is a necessary party.  Respondent has not demonstrated that complete relief as between respondent and the Department cannot be accorded without joining Golden Harvest. To the extent respondent seeks to establish that Golden Harvest is responsible, in whole or in part, for the violation alleged in the complaint, he may do so without joining Golden Harvest as a party. <page number="15" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> Moreover, although respondent indicates that the pond  constructed on the property is necessary for Golden Harvest's orchard  operation and that there might be "difficulties" in modifying the pond's  structure without losing its agricultural  value (Grout Affidavit at 5, P 5), respondent does not demonstrate conclusively that loss of the pond's  use would be a necessary result of granting the relief staff  seeks, namely, restoration of the protected stream.  Thus, respondent has not established at this point in the proceeding that Golden Harvest will be inequitably affected by an order in this matter. Accordingly, respondent has not demonstrated that the complaint must be dismissed on this ground. <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_45_721_248"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> Department staff's   motion to strike  the fourth affirmative defense  is addressed below.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>3. Remaining Defenses</p><p>In the remainder of respondent's motion, respondent argues that the complaint should be dismissed based upon its remaining defenses: (1) the lack of a permit requirement  for construction of an agricultural   pond;  (2) laches  or administrative delay; and (3) equitable estoppel.  In support of these defenses, respondent submits the affidavit of Alan Grout and various other documents. <page number="16" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

Department Staff's   Motion To Strike  Affirmative Defenses</p><p>Department staff  moves to strike the four defenses pleaded  in respondent's July 7, 2014, answer. Motions to strike defenses in proceedings under Part <page number="18" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> 622 are governed by the standards governing motions to dismiss  defenses under CPLR 3211(b) (see Matter of Truisi, Ruling of the Chief ALJ on Motion To Strike  or Clarify Affirmative Defenses, April 1, 2010, at 10-11). Motions to dismiss may either challenge the pleading facially -- i.e., on the ground that it fails to state a claim or defense -- or may seek to establish, with supporting evidentiary material, that a claim or defense lacks merit as a matter of law  (see id. at 10). Here, staff  does not support its motion with evidentiary material. Accordingly, respondent's pleadings are examined to determine whether defenses are stated.</p><p>1. First Affirmative Defense  -- Permit Requirement </p><p>Section 622.4(c) of 6 NYCRR provides that "[w]henever the complaint alleges that respondent conducted an activity without a required permit, a defense based upon the inapplicability of the permit requirement  to the activity shall constitute an affirmative defense. " Here, respondent pleads that because the pond  constructed at the property by Golden Harvest is a permissible agricultural  activity under ECL 24-0701(4), respondent was not required to obtain a freshwater wetlands  permit.</p><p>Department staff  argues<page number="19" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> that it did not charge respondent for a violation of the freshwater wetland   permit requirement  of ECL 24-0701. Instead, Department staff  charged respondent with violating the requirements of 6 NYCRR 608.2(a), which requires a Part 608 stream  protection permit for disturbances  of protected streams.  Accordingly, staff  moves to dismiss the first defense pleaded  in the answer.</p><p>The first defense should be dismissed. Pursuant to ECL 15-0501(1) and its implementing regulations,  "no person or public corporation shall change, modify or disturb the course, channel or bed  of any stream  as defined in subdivision 2, or remove any sand, gravel or other material from the bed  or banks of such a stream  without a permit issued pursuant to subdivision 3 of this section" (see also 6 NYCRR 608.2[a]). Subdivision 2 of section 15-0501 defines protected streams  as including streams  classified as C(T) (see also 6 NYCRR 608.1[aa]).</p><p>The exemption for agricultural  activities included in ECL 24-0701(4) from the requirements for freshwater wetlands  permits does not apply to protection of streams  permits under ECL 15-0501 and 6 NYCRR 608.2(a). Moreover, although ECL 15-0501 contains an exemption from its permit<page number="20" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> requirements for certain agricultural  activities, those activities do not include the activities alleged in this proceeding -- the disturbance  of the bed  and banks of a protected stream,  and the burying of that stream  in about 500 feet of pipe (see ECL 15-0501[7]; 6 NYCRR 608.2[b][2]). Thus, respondent fails to state a defense to the permit requirement  of ECL 15-0501 and 6 NYCRR 608.2.</p><p>2. Second Affirmative Defense  -- Laches  and Administrative Delay</p><p>In his second defense, respondent asserts that the Department is guilty of laches  or failure to bring the proceeding within a reasonable period of time in accordance with SAPA, 6 NYCRR part 622, and the holding of <citation type="case" normalizedCite="66 N.Y.2d 169,at 178"><content>Matter of Cortlandt Nursing Home v Axelrod (<span normalizedCite="66 N.Y.2d 169">66 NY2d 169<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000066#000169#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="66 N.Y.2d 169">178<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000066#000169#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1985], cert denied <citation type="case" normalizedCite="476 U.S. 1115"><content><span normalizedCite="476 U.S. 1115">476 US 1115<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#52#3#000476#001115#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1986]) by failing to commence this proceeding within a reasonable time after the alleged violation occurred.

Accordingly, as noted above, respondent's defense is reviewed only to determine whether a defense is stated. To the extent respondent pleads a laches  defense, that defense is unavailable against a State agency acting in a governmental capacity to enforce a public right (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="66 N.Y.2d 169,at 177"><content>Matter of Cortlandt, <span normalizedCite="66 N.Y.2d at 177">66 NY2d at 177 n 2<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000066#000177#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>).</content></citation> Thus, the second defense should be dismissed in part.</p><p>To the extent respondent pleads a defense of administrative delay based upon Cortlandt, respondent sufficiently states a defense.

Respondent also alleges the loss of witnesses and evidence necessary to his defense. Some of the alleged lost evidence is relevant only to respondent's claim that Stuyvesant Brook is misclassified and, thus, is irrelevant to issues in this proceeding (see Matter of Costa, ALJ Ruling on Motions, Dec. 11, 2007, at 7 [administrative enforcement proceeding  not the proper forum to challenge a stream  classification; stream  reclassification to be raised through appropriate administrative process]; see also ECL 17-0301). However, respondent also alleges that the passage of time has resulted in the loss of witnesses to the various inspections by and discussions with Department staff  during the construction of the agricultural   pond,  and the approvals that were<page number="23" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> allegedly provided by the Department. Thus, respondent pleads the loss of witnesses and evidence relevant to the charges in this matter.</p><p>Finally, respondent pleads injury to his private interest, namely the costs associated with removing the completed construction in order to return the stream  to its prior condition. Therefore, respondent pleads a Cortlandt defense sufficient to place staff  on notice  of the factual assertions underlying the defense (see Stasack, at 9). Accordingly, Department staff's   motion to dismiss  respondent's second defense should otherwise be denied.</p><p>3. Third Affirmative Defense  -- Equitable Estoppel </p><p>As a third affirmative defense,  respondent claims that the Department should be equitably estopped from bringing an enforcement proceeding  against respondent because staff  negligently or wrongfully misrepresented to respondent that no permits were required to construct an agricultural   pond  on the Fordham Road property, and that he relied on those misrepresentations when he purchased the property, constructed the agricultural   pond,  and developed the orchard. </p><p>Department staff  moves to dismiss the third defense on the ground that any representations concerning permits<page number="24" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

To plead an estoppel defense, respondent must allege facts that show in what manner and to what extent respondent relied on the complainant's inconsistent conduct and was prejudiced  thereby (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="36 A.D.2d 852,at 853"><content>Glenesk, <span normalizedCite="36 A.D.2d at 853">36 AD2d at 853<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000036#000853#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>).</content></citation></p><p>On a motion to dismiss  affirmative defenses, the answer is liberally construed, the facts alleged are accepted as true, and the pleader is afforded every possible inference (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="84 N.Y.2d 83,at 87"><content>Leon v Martinez, <span normalizedCite="84 N.Y.2d at 87">84 NY2d at 87<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000084#000087#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation><citation type="case" normalizedCite="58 A.D.3d 145,at 148"><content>Butler v Catinella, <span normalizedCite="58 A.D.3d 145">58 AD3d 145<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000058#000145#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="58 A.D.3d 145">148<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000058#000145#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2d Dept 2008]; see also Truisi, at 10; Matter of ExxonMobil Oil Corp., ALJ Ruling, Sept. 13, 2002, at 3). A motion to dismiss  will be denied if the answer, taken as a whole, alleges facts giving rise to a cognizable defense (see Truisi, at 10; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="21 A.D.2d 60,at 64"><content>Foley v D'Agostino, <span normalizedCite="21 A.D.2d 60">21 AD2d 60<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000021#000060#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="21 A.D.2d 60">64-65<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000021#000060#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1st Dept 1964]). In addition, affidavits submitted in opposition to the motion may be used to save an inartfully pleaded,  but potentially meritorious, defense (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="47 A.D.3d 879,at 881"><content>Faulkner v City of New York, <span normalizedCite="47 A.D.3d 879">47 AD3d 879<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000047#000879#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="47 A.D.3d 879">881<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000047#000879#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2d Dept 2008]).</p><p>Here, <page number="26" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> liberally construing the answer and examining respondent Grout's affirmation  gives rise to a cognizable defense. Respondent alleges that he repeatedly contacted the Department -- prior to purchasing the property at issue, prior to constructing the pond,  and during pond  construction -- to inquire whether permits were required for the project. Respondent also alleged that Department staff  made repeated site visits. Respondent asserts that Department staff  repeatedly assured him that no permits were required for the project, and that staff  did not identify any stream  as C(T) when observing the property. Respondent alleges that staff  did not notify respondent that there might be a trout stream  on the property until July 2008, during construction of the pond,  and that staff  did not inform respondent that a permit might be required until after the construction was completed.</p><p>These allegations, taken together, sufficiently allege prejudice to respondent arising from his justifiable reliance upon staff's  statements that no permits were required for respondent's project. Thus, respondent has stated a defense, if not to liability, then at least in mitigation of any penalty or remedial relief<page number="27" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> that might be imposed in this matter. Accordingly, Department staff's   motion to dismiss  the third affirmative defense  should be denied.</p><p>4. Fourth Affirmative Defense  -- Necessary Party </p><p>As noted above, in his fourth affirmative defense,  respondent alleges that the complaint fails to name Golden Farm as a necessary party  to this proceeding. Although respondent has not demonstrated that he is entitled to dismissal of the complaint based on this defense, he has nonetheless stated the defense sufficiently to place Department staff  on notice  of the defense. Thus, Department staff's   motion to dismiss  the fourth affirmative defense  should be denied.</p><p>III. RULING</p><p>Based upon the foregoing discussion, it is hereby ordered that:</p><p>1. Respondent's request to strike Department staff's  July 28, 2014 attorney's affirmation  is granted on the ground that the submission is an unauthorized reply on staff's  motion to amend  the complaint and to strike affirmative defenses (see 6 NYCRR 622.6[c][3]).</p><p>2. Respondent's motion to dismiss  the June 25, 2014 complaint is denied.</p><p>3. Department staff's  motion, insofar as it seeks leave to amend  the June 25, 2014 complaint, is granted in part, and the June 25, <page number="28" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 41"/> 2014 complaint corrected to identify the subject stream  as "Stuyvesant Brook" with stream  identification number  H-209-1. Staff's  motion to amend  the complaint is otherwise denied as unnecessary.</p><p>4. Department staff's  motion, insofar as it seeks to strike affirmative defenses, is granted in part and the first affirmative defense  and that portion of the second affirmative defense  that pleads a laches  defense, is dismissed. Staff's  motion to strike  affirmative defenses is otherwise denied.</p><p>Dated: December 12, 2014</p><p>Albany, New York</p></bodyText></decisionOpinion></opinions></administrativeDecision></administrativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5GKS-NNG0-003Y-J0VB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">5479</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2015-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><paginationScheme pageScheme="2014 N.Y.
