Martens, Commissioner</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDER</emphasis></h><p>This administrative enforcement proceeding concerns the failure of respondent Wendy Daby to comply with New York State's petroleum  bulk storage  regulations at a petroleum  bulk storage  facility (PBS No. 5-514063) she owns located at 8179 State Route 3, hamlet of Vermontville, Town of Franklin, Franklin County, New York ("facility"). The facility, which is known as the Birch Bark Deli, was a convenience store that at one time engaged in the retail sale of gasoline  and diesel fuel. </p><p>At the facility are four aboveground petroleum  storage  tanks  with a combined capacity of 14,550 gallons  and which are designated Tank  Nos. 001, 002, 004 and 005, respectively. Tank  No. 001 has a capacity of 8,000 gallons  and is intended for the storage  of gasoline  and ethanol. Tank  No. 002 has a capacity of 6,000 gallons  and is intended for the storage  of diesel fuel.  Tank  Nos. 004 and 005 each have a capacity of 275 gallons  and are intended for the storage  of No. 2 fuel oil for onsite consumption. The facility is subject to the State's petroleum  bulk storage  regulations (see 6 NYCRR 612.1[b]).</p><p>Staff  of the New York State Department of Environmental<page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> Conservation ("DEC" or "Department") commenced this administrative enforcement proceeding by serving a notice of hearing  and complaint dated July 7, 2014 upon respondent. The papers were personally served  on respondent on July 13, 2014. Accordingly, service of process was accomplished pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.3. Respondent failed to answer the complaint.</p><p>Staff's  complaint alleges that, based upon records that the Department maintains and upon an inspection  of the facility by Department staff  on May 24, 2013, six regulatory violations were observed or documented:</p><p>a. 6 NYCRR 612.2(a)(2) -- failure to renew the PBS registration  for the facility which expired on July 1, 2014;</p><p>b. 6 NYCRR 612.2(e) -- failure to display  at the facility a registration  certificate  that was current and valid;</p><p>c. 6 NYCRR 613.3(b) -- failure to permanently  mark all fill  ports  to identify the product inside  Tank  Nos. 004 and 005;</p><p>d. 6 NYCRR 613.3(c)(6)(i) -- failure to install secondary  containment  for Tank  Nos. 004 and 005;</p><p>e. 6 NYCRR 613.9(a) -- failure to temporarily  close Tank  Nos. 001 and 002; and</p><p>f. 6 NYCRR 613.9(b) -- failure to permanently  close Tank  Nos. 001, 002 and 005.</p><p>Staff,  in its <page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> complaint, sought an order directing respondent to undertake various remedial measures  at the facility and to pay a civil penalty  in the amount of eleven thousand three hundred dollars  ($ 11,300).</p><p>Department staff  personally served  a "Notice  of Hearing-Default" dated September 30, 2014 ("Notice" ) on respondent on October 6, 2014. The Notice  stated that, on December 2, 2014 the matter would be called before an administrative law judge ("ALJ"). It further stated, in part, that respondent's failure to appear would constitute a default  and a waiver of her right to be heard, and could result in a Commissioner's order being issued against her (see Hearing Exhibit ["Exh"] 13, at page 2).</p><p>Attached to the Notice  that was served on respondent was a proposed Commissioner's order that Department staff  drafted (see Exh 2 attached to Exh 13). The Staff-drafted order modified both the civil penalty  and the remedial measures  that were set forth in the complaint. As noted, in the complaint, staff  requested assessment of a payable civil penalty  of eleven thousand three hundred dollars  ($ 11,300) (see Exh 12, Complaint [Section II, at page 8 (Wherefore Clause)]). Although retaining an overall penalty<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> request of eleven thousand three hundred dollars  ($ 11,300), Department staff  in the Notice  is seeking a payable penalty of only three thousand dollars  ($ 3,000) with the remaining portion (that is, eight thousand three hundred dollars  [$ 8,300]) suspended,  contingent upon respondent implementing specified remedial measures  at the facility (see Exh 2 to Exh 13, Proposed Commissioner's Order, Section V). As to the remedial measures,  Department staff  is no longer requesting submission of a registration  renewal application and is providing sixty (60) days for the submission of documentation  relative to the installation of secondary  containment  (compare Exh 12, Complaint [Section III, at pages 8-10] with Exh 2 to Exh 13, Proposed Commissioner's Order [Section VI]). Furthermore, in contrast to the complaint, staff,  in the Notice,  no longer requests that respondent be held liable for a violation of 6 NYCRR 612.2(a)(2).</p><p>The matter was heard by ALJ Richard R. Wissler on December 2, 2014. Respondent did not appear. Accordingly, Department staff  moved for a default judgment  on the complaint and submitted exhibits in support of its motion. ALJ Wissler has prepared the attached default  summary<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> report which I adopt as my decision in this matter, subject to the following comments.</p><p>For purposes of this proceeding, I am considering only the findings, civil penalty  and remedial measures  that staff  set forth in its proposed Commissioner's order and attached to the Notice  (see Exh 2 to Exh 13), and I am treating the staff-drafted order as an amendment to the findings, penalty and remedial measures  in staff's  complaint.</p><p>These modifications to the findings, penalty and remedial measures  were in the last set of papers that respondent received and these modifications impose lesser charges and obligations on respondent than those set forth in the complaint. As noted, the revised penalty request includes a suspended  portion (whereas staff's  original request in the complaint did not suspend any portion of the penalty), and the modified remedial measures  eliminate one obligation and provide an extended timeframe for another. In addition, one of the alleged violations (failure to register the facility - 6 NYCRR 612.2[a][2]) was dropped. Imposing lesser charges and obligations do not raise due process concerns or otherwise prejudice respondent in this default  proceeding (see, e.g, Matter<page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> of EV 1st Ave. Prop. Owner, L.P., ALJ Hearing Report, June 5, 2014, at 2, adopted in relevant part by Order of the Commissioner, Sept. 29, 2014, at 1-2). I note, however, that no explanation for these changes were provided. In future proceedings, staff  should provide an explanation for any changes that it may propose to the original complaint or other charging instrument. Such explanation may be by written submission or orally on the record.</p><p>With respect to the penalty, ECL 71-1929 provides for a civil penalty  of up to thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars  ($ 37,500) per day for each violation of titles 1 through 11 inclusive and title 19 of ECL article 17, or the rules or regulations promulgated thereto. Title 10 of ECL article 17 establishes the requirements governing petroleum  bulk storage,  with applicable regulations at 6 NYCRR parts 612, 613 and 614. In consideration of DEE-1 (Civil Penalty  Policy) dated June 20, 1990, DEE-22 (Petroleum  Bulk Storage  Inspection  Enforcement Policy - Penalty Schedule) dated May 21, 2003, and ECL 71-1929, and based upon my review of the record, I am adopting the ALJ's recommendation to assess a civil penalty  against respondent of eleven thousand<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> three hundred dollars  ($ 11,300), of which three thousand dollars  ($ 3,000) will be payable within thirty (30) days of the service of this order upon respondent. The remaining amount of eight thousand three hundred dollars  ($ 8,300) will be suspended  contingent upon respondent's compliance with the terms of this order. This penalty, which is significantly below the statutory maximum, is authorized and warranted.</p><p>I have also reviewed the requested remedial measures  that Department staff  included in the Notice,  and these measures are authorized and appropriate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">NOW, THEREFORE</emphasis>, having considered this matter and being duly advised, it is <emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDERED</emphasis> that:</p><p>I. Pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15, Department staff's  motion for a default judgment  on the complaint, as the complaint's findings, civil penalty  and remedial measures  were amended by staff's  proposed Commissioner's order that was attached to the Notice  of Hearing-Default, is granted.</p><p>II. Respondent Wendy Daby is adjudged to be in default  and to have waived the right to a hearing in this enforcement proceeding. Accordingly, the allegations in Department staff's  complaint against respondent are deemed to have been admitted by her.<br/><page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/><br/>III. Moreover, based on record evidence, respondent Wendy Daby, with respect to a petroleum  storage  facility she owns and which is located at 8179 State Route 3, hamlet of Vermontville, Town of Franklin, Franklin County, New York, is adjudged to have violated:</p><p>A. 6 NYCRR 612.2(e), for failing to display  at the facility a registration  certificate  that was current and valid;</p><p>B. 6 NYCRR 613.3(b), for failing to permanently  mark all fill  ports  to identify the product inside  Tank  Nos. 004 and 005;</p><p>C. 6 NYCRR 613.3(c)(6)(i), for failing to install secondary  containment  for Tank  Nos. 004 and 005;</p><p>D. 6 NYCRR 613.9(a), for failing to temporarily  close Tank  Nos. 001 and 002; and</p><p>E. 6 NYCRR 613.9(b), for failing to permanently  close Tank  Nos. 001, 002 and 005.</p><p>IV. Respondent Wendy Daby is hereby assessed a civil penalty  in the amount of eleven thousand three hundred dollars  ($ 11,300). Respondent shall pay the sum of three thousand dollars  ($ 3,000) within thirty (30) days after service of this order upon her. Payment shall be made in the form of a cashier's check, certified check or money order payable to the order of the "New York State Department of Environmental Conservation" <page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> and delivered to the Department at the following address: Betty Douglas, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Office of General Counsel - Region 5, P.O. Box 296, Ray Brook, New York 12977.</p><p>The balance of the civil penalty,  eight thousand three hundred dollars  ($ 8,300), shall be suspended  on the condition that respondent complies with the terms of this order. In the event Department staff  determines that respondent has failed to comply with this order, the suspended  sum of eight thousand three hundred dollars  ($ 8,300) shall be due within thirty (30) days of service on respondent of written notice  by Department staff.  Department staff's  determination of noncompliance shall be final and binding on respondent.</p><p>V. Respondent Wendy Daby is ordered to complete the following remedial actions:</p><p>A. Within ten (10) days after service of this order upon respondent Wendy Daby, respondent shall notify Department staff  of her choice to permanently  or temporarily  close Tank  No. 001 and Tank  No. 002.</p><p>B. If respondent elects to permanently  close Tank  No. 001 and Tank  No. 002, she shall perform the following actions with respect to Tank  No. 001 and Tank  No. 002 within thirty<page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> (30) days after service of this order upon respondent:</p><p>1. All liquid in the tanks  and lines shall be removed and disposed of in accordance with applicable State and federal requirements;</p><p>2. The manholes at the top of the tanks  shall be removed, the insides  of the tanks  shall be cleaned, and respondent shall dispose of the liquid and sludge properly and in accordance with applicable State and federal requirements. Where required, respondent shall retain a qualified contractor to enter the confined space;</p><p>3. Respondent shall disconnect the lines and securely cap or lock the fill  ports  and other lines to prevent unauthorized use;</p><p>4. Respondent shall stencil the date of permanent closure on the tanks; </p><p>5. Respondent shall protect the tanks  from floatation in accordance with good engineering practices, and shall notify Department staff  in writing of the method that will be used to so protect the tanks.  Department staff  retains the discretion to approve or reject the method chosen; and</p><p>6. Within ten (10) days of completing the work required in this paragraph B (subparagraphs 1-5), respondent shall accurately complete, sign and mail a PBS application to Department staff,  permanently <page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> closing Tank  No. 001 and Tank  No. 002.</p><p>C. If respondent Wendy Daby chooses not to permanently  close Tank  No. 001 and Tank  No. 002 at the facility, respondent shall perform the following actions:</p><p>1. Within thirty (30) days after service of this order upon her, properly and temporarily  close Tank  No. 001 and Tank  No. 002 in accordance with the requirements of 6 NYCRR 613.9(a). Respondent shall submit to Department staff  photographs showing that Tank  No. 001 and Tank  No. 002 have been so temporarily  closed;</p><p>2.

Respondent shall submit to Department staff  photo documentation  of the color coding's compliance with the requirements of 6 NYCRR 613.3(b);</p><p>3. Within thirty (30) days after service of this order upon her, submit to Department staff  a plan to install secondary  containment  or the equipment that meets the Department's Inspection  Handbook DER-25 requirements for Tank  No. 004 and Tank  No. 005, which could be reasonably expected to<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> discharge petroleum  to the waters of the State, in accordance with the requirements of 6 NYCRR 613.3(c)(6); and</p><p>4. Within sixty (60) days after service of this order upon her, submit documentation  that the required secondary  containment  system set forth in paragraph V.C.3 of this order has been so installed.</p><p>VI. Except as set forth in Section IV, all communications from respondent Wendy Daby to Department staff  concerning this order shall be made to:</p><p>Scott Abrahamson, Esq.<br/>Assistant Regional Attorney<br/>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Region 5<br/>P.O.

Box 296<br/>Ray Brook, NY 12977.</p><p>V. Provide such other and further relief as the Commissioner may deem appropriate.</p><p>The notice of hearing  annexed  to and served with the complaint on July 13, 2014, indicated that an answer to the complaint was due within twenty days of service of the complaint. <page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> Respondent failed to answer the complaint. Moreover, the notice of hearing  annexed  to and served with the complaint on July 13, 2014, indicated that a conference was scheduled in the matter for August 11, 2014, at 2:00 p.m. at the Department's Region 5 office in Ray Brook, New York. Respondent did appear for the scheduled conference.</p><p>On October 6, 2014, respondent was personally served  with a notice  of default  hearing dated September 30, 2014, stating that on December 2, 2014, at 10:00 a.m., at the Department's Region 5 sub-office in Warrensburg, New York, the matter would be called before the undersigned Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") of the Department's Office of Hearings and Mediation Services ("OHMS"). This notice  stated that, at that time, the Department intended to move for a default judgment  against respondent due to her failure to answer the complaint served upon her on July 13, 2014.</p><p>Respondent was advised that she could appear personally or by counsel on December 2, 2014, to present argument in opposition to the motion for default judgment.  Respondent was further advised that her failure to appear would constitute a default  and a waiver of her right to be heard, and<page number="22" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> could result in a Commissioner's order being issued against her. The notice  further stated that upon making the motion for default judgment,  Department staff  would be seeking an order of the Commissioner imposing a civil penalty  of $ 11,300 for the violations alleged in the complaint. Respondent did not file a response to the notice. </p><p>On December 2, 2014, and pursuant to the notice  dated September 30, 2014, a calendar call was convened before the undersigned ALJ at the Department's Region 5 sub-office, 232 Golf Club Road, Warrensburg, New York 12885. At that time, respondent's matter was called. Department staff  was represented by Scott Abrahamson, Esq., Assistant Regional Attorney for Region 5. No one appeared on behalf of respondent.</p><p>Pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15, Mr. Abrahamson, on behalf of Department staff,  orally moved for a default judgment  against respondent based upon her failure to answer the complaint dated July 7, 2014. In support of its motion for default,  Department staff  submitted thirteen (13) exhibits, all of which were admitted into the record. A summary of the exhibits is attached hereto. To introduce the foregoing exhibits and provide further support for its motion<page number="23" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> for default,  Department staff  also called two staff  witnesses: Russell B. Mulvey, P.E., Environmental Engineer 2, Division of Environmental Remediation, Region 5; and Benjamin X. Hankins, Environmental Engineer 1, Region 5.</p><p>Default  Provisions</p><p>In accordance with 6 NYCRR 622.4(a), a respondent upon whom a complaint has been served must file an answer to the complaint within twenty days of the date of such service. A failure to timely file an answer to the complaint constitutes a default  in the action. A failure to timely respond to the motion constitutes a default.  As applicable herein, the Department's default  procedures in an enforcement action, found at 6 NYCRR 622.15, provide:</p><p>"(a) A respondent's failure to file a timely answer … constitutes a default  and a waiver of respondent's right to a hearing. If [this] occurs the department staff  may make a motion to the ALJ for a default judgment. </p><p>"(b) The motion for a default judgment  may be made orally on the record … and must contain:</p><p>(1) proof of service upon the respondent of the notice of hearing  and complaint … ;</p><p>(2) proof of the respondent's failure to appear or failure to file a timely answer; and</p><p>(3) a proposed<page number="24" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> order."</p><p>As the Commissioner stated in Matter of Alvin Hunt, d/b/a Our Cleaners (Decision and Order dated July 25, 2006, at 4), "[t]he consequences of a default  is that the respondent waives the right to a hearing and is deemed to have admitted the factual allegations of the complaint or other accusatory instrument on the issue of liability for the violations charged." Moreover, the Commissioner has stated, "a defaulting respondent is deemed to have admitted the factual allegations of the complaint and all reasonable inferences that flow from them." (id . at 6.) Accordingly, the following findings of fact are based upon the exhibits submitted into the record, as identified above.</p><p>Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</p><p>1. Respondent Wendy Daby possesses fee title to a certain piece of real property located at 8179 State Route 3, Hamlet of Vermontville, Town of Franklin, Franklin County, New York 12989 by virtue of a deed transferring ownership to her on May 7, 2009, recorded in the office of the Franklin County in Book 999 of Deeds at page 223. (Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraph 4 and Exhibit 1, annexed  to the Complaint; Department Staff  Exhibit 9.)</p><p>2. The site<page number="25" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> is known as the Birch Bark Deli ("facility") and was a convenience store which at one time engaged in the retail sale of gasoline  and diesel fuel.  (Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraph 3; Department Staff  Exhibit 6A; Hearing Record, Testimony of Russell B. Mulvey, P.E., Environmental Engineer 2, Division of Environmental Remediation, Region 5; and Benjamin X. Hankins, Environmental Engineer 1, Region 5.)</p><p>3. There are four petroleum  storage  tanks  at the facility with a combined capacity of 14,550 gallons.  All of the tanks  are aboveground storage  tanks  ("ASTs"). The ASTs are designated Tank  Nos. 001, 002, 004 and 005. Tank  No. 001 has a capacity of 8,000 gallons  and is intended for the storage  of gasoline  and ethanol. Tank  No. 002 has a capacity of 6,000 gallons  and is intended for the storage  of diesel fuel.  Tank  Nos. 004 and 005 each have a capacity of 275 gallons  and are intended for the storage  of No. 2 fuel oil for onsite consumption. (Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraphs 7 and 8, and Exhibit 2, annexed  to the Complaint; Department Staff  Exhibit 3 and 6B; Hearing Record, Testimony of Russell B. Mulvey, P.E., Environmental Engineer 2, Division of Environmental<page number="26" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> Remediation, Region 5; and Benjamin X. Hankins, Environmental Engineer 1, Region 5.)</p><p>4. The facility has been registered with the Department and has been issued Petroleum  Bulk Storage  ("PBS") Certificate  No. 5-514063. This PBS Certificate  was issued to the owner of the facility, respondent Wendy Daby, on July 1, 2009. The certificate  expired on July 1, 2014, prior to the initiation of the instant enforcement action. (Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraph 7, and Exhibit 2, annexed  to the Complaint; Department Staff  Exhibit 3; Hearing Record, Testimony of Russell B. Mulvey, P.E., Environmental Engineer 2, Division of Environmental Remediation, Region 5; and Benjamin X. Hankins, Environmental Engineer 1, Region 5.)</p><p>5. On May 24, 2013, Department staff  inspected the facility and observed the following conditions, each a violation of the cited applicable regulatory provision:</p><p>a. Failure to display  at the facility a registration  certificate  that was current and valid, a violation of 6 NYCRR 612.2(e);</p><p>b. Failure to permanently  mark all fill  ports  to identify the product inside  Tank  Nos. 004 and 005, a violation of 6 NYCRR 613.3(b);</p><p>c. Failure to install secondary  containment <page number="27" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> for Tank  Nos. 004 and 005, a violation of 6 NYCRR 613.3(c)(6)(i);</p><p>d. Failure to temporarily  close Tank  Nos. 001 and 002, a violation of 6 NYCRR 613.9(a);</p><p>e. 6 NYCRR 613.9(b) by Failure to permanently  close Tank  Nos. 001, 002 and 005, a violation of 6 NYCRR 613.9(b).</p><p>(Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraphs 39 through 43; Department Staff  Exhibits 1, 2, 4B and 6.)</p><p>6. The violation alleged in Finding of Fact 5(a) above consisted of respondent's failure display  a PBS registration  certificate  that had been signed by her and that contained current information as to the status of the tanks  located at the facility. These items were corrected onsite at the time of the facility inspection  on May 24, 2013. (Department Staff  Exhibits 2 and 4B.)</p><p>7. A subsequent review of Department records after July 1, 2014, and before filing the complaint in this matter, dated July 7, 2014, indicated that the facility's PBS registration  had not been renewed and had expired as of July 1, 2014, a violation of 6 NYCRR 612.2(a)(2). (Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraph 38; Department Staff  Exhibit 3; Hearing Record, Testimony of Russell B. Mulvey, P.E., Environmental Engineer 2, <page number="28" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> Division of Environmental Remediation, Region 5; and Benjamin X. Hankins, Environmental Engineer 1, Region 5.)</p><p>8. By letter dated June 18, 2013, Department staff  advised respondent of the various PBS regulatory violations that had been observed during the inspection  on May 24, 2013. The letter further advised respondent that she had thirty days from the date of the letter to correct the violations and to submit appropriate documentation  in support thereof. Respondent did not respond to this letter. (Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraphs 16 and 17; Department Staff  Exhibits 2 and 4B; Hearing Record, Testimony of Russell B. Mulvey, P.E., Environmental Engineer 2, Division of Environmental Remediation, Region 5; and Benjamin X. Hankins, Environmental Engineer 1, Region 5.)</p><p>9. By letter dated January 22, 2014, Department staff  advised respondent that they had not received information demonstrating compliance with the directive in their letter of June 18, 2013, that the PBS violations observed during the May 24, 2013, inspection  be corrected within thirty days. The January 22, 2014, letter gave respondent until February 21, 2014, to submit the necessary documentation.  <page number="29" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> Respondent did not respond to this letter. (Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraphs 18 and 19, and Exhibit 4 thereto; Department Staff  Exhibit 5; Hearing Record, Testimony of Russell B. Mulvey, P.E., Environmental Engineer 2, Division of Environmental Remediation, Region 5; and Benjamin X. Hankins, Environmental Engineer 1, Region 5.)</p><p>10. By letter dated March 6, 2014, Michelle Crew, Regional Attorney for Region 5, offered to resolve the violations observed during the inspection  on May 24, 2013, through an order on consent, a copy of which Ms. Crew enclosed in her letter. Respondent was advised that she had until March 25, 2014, to execute the proposed order and that, if she failed to do so, the Department would proceed with a formal enforcement proceeding against her through service of a notice of hearing  and complaint. Respondent did not respond to this letter. (Department Staff  Exhibit 12, Complaint, Paragraphs 20 and 21; Department Staff  Exhibit 8, Affirmation of Regional Attorney Michelle Crew with letter of March 6, 2014, attached.)</p><p>11. The notice of hearing  in this matter and the complaint, dated July 7, 2014, alleging the various regulatory violations enumerated<page number="30" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> in Findings of Fact 5 and 7, above, was personally served  upon respondent on July 13, 2014, by Environmental Conservation Officer ("ECO") James Cranker. (Department Staff  Exhibits 11 and 12.)</p><p>12. The notice of hearing  served on July 13, 2014, with the complaint stated that an answer to the complaint had to be filed within twenty days of the receipt of the complaint by respondent and that failure to file an answer to the complaint would constitute a default  in the matter. Respondent failed to file an answer to the complaint. (Department Staff  Exhibit 12 and Hearing Record.)</p><p>13. The notice  of default  hearing in this matter, dated September 30, 2014, was personally served  upon respondent on October 6, 2014, by ECO James Cranker. (Department Staff  Exhibits 11 and 13.)</p><p>14. The notice  of default  hearing stated that the default  hearing would be held on December 2, 2014, at 10:00 AM, before the undersigned ALJ, at the Department's Region 5 sub-offices located at 232 Golf Course Road, Warrensburg, New York 12885. Respondent failed to appear for the default  hearing. (Department Staff  Exhibit 13 and Hearing Record.)</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The record shows that respondent was duly served with the<page number="31" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> notice of hearing  and complaint on July 13. 2014. The record further shows that respondent failed to file an answer to the complaint. Moreover, the record shows that respondent was duly served with the notice  of default  hearing in this matter on October 6, 2014, and that she failed to appear for the default  hearing scheduled for December 2, 2014. Staff  has also submitted a proposed order in accordance with 6 NYCRR 622.15(b)(3). The Department is entitled to a default judgment  in this matter on the complaint pursuant to the provisions of 6 NYCRR 622.15.</p><p>Department staff's  proposed order and the $ 11,300 civil penalty  it seeks are consistent with the Department's penalty policy as well as applicable provisions of ECL article 71. As to the proposed penalty in this matter, Department staff  is seeking a payable penalty of $ 3,000 and a suspension of the remainder of the penalty in the amount of $ 8,300 conditioned upon respondent implementing certain corrective measures. Moreover, it should be noted that Department staff  undertook to complete a financial analysis in this matter to determine respondent's ability to pay any civil penalty.  This analysis was not fully completed due to respondent's<page number="32" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 22"/> failure to provide Department staff  with certain financial information. However, as evidenced, in particular, by respondent's purchase in 2014 of a motor vehicle for $ 23,000, Department staff  concluded that respondent had not demonstrated that she was incapable of paying a civil penalty  in this matter. (Department Staff  Exhibit 10, Affidavit of Sharon L. Brooks, Principal Economist, Region 5.)</p><p>Recommendation</p><p>Based upon the foregoing, I recommend that the Commissioner issue an order:</p><p>1. Granting Department staff's  motion for default  on the complaint pursuant to the provisions of 6 NYCRR 622.15;</p><p>2. Finding respondent in violation of the various sections of 6 NYCRR parts 612 and 613 alleged against her as enumerated in the complaint and in Findings of Fact 5 and 7, above, for and at a petroleum  storage  facility owned by her located at 8179 State Route 3, Hamlet of Vermontville, Town of Franklin, Franklin County, New York 12989, known as the Birch Bark Deli;</p><p>3. Ordering respondent to undertake such remedial and curative actions as are delineated in Recital III of the proposed Commissioner order;</p><p>4. Directing respondent, within 30 days of the service of this order upon her, <page number="33" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Martens, Commissioner</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDER</emphasis></h><p>On May 12, 2015, an adjudicatory hearing  was convened  before Molly T. McBride, Administrative Law  Judge ("ALJ") of the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("Department"). The hearing addressed the allegations of Department staff  that respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. ("respondent") violated ECL 17-1009 and 6 NYCRR 612.2 by failing to renew  the registration  of its petroleum  storage facility  located at 715 West 170th Street, New York, New York ("facility").</p><p>ALJ McBride prepared the attached hearing report, which I adopt as my decision in this matter, subject to my comments below. As set forth in the ALJ's hearing report, respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. failed to file  an answer to the complaint served by Department staff  in this matter, failed to appear at a pre-hearing  conference scheduled  for February 24, 2015, as directed in the cover letter  served with the notice of hearing  and complaint, and failed to appear for the adjudicatory hearing  scheduled  in the matter on March 24, 2015, as directed in the notice of hearing  (see Hearing Report at 4 [Finding of Fact No. 8]).<br/><page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/><br/>As a consequence of respondent's failure to answer  or appear in this matter, the ALJ recommends that Department staff's  motion for default  be granted (see Hearing Report, at 5). Pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15(b), a motion for default judgment  may be made orally  on the record or in writing and must contain:</p><p>"(1) proof of service  upon the respondent of the notice of hearing  and complaint or such other document which commenced the proceeding;</p><p>"(2) proof of respondent's failure to appear or failure to file a timely answer; and</p><p>"(3) a proposed order. "</p><p>In this matter, staff  requested that the ALJ consider staff's  findings and relief contained in the wherefore clause of staff's  complaint as staff's  proposed order  (see Hearing Report at 5 n 1). Although it is preferred that Department staff  submit a separately drafted proposed order  for purposes of satisfying 6 NYCRR 622.15(b)(3), staff  may move orally  to treat specific language  in its complaint or its motion for order without hearing as the proposed order.  If staff  relies on identified provisions in its pleadings or motion as its draft order, however, those provisions must be sufficient to enable the administrative law  judge to make<page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> a finding that the requirements of 6 NYCRR 622.15(b) have been adequately met (see 6 NYCRR 622.15[c]). The ALJ so concluded here and, upon my review of the record, I agree that in this instance staff's  motion to treat specific language  in its complaint as the proposed order  satisfied 6 NYCRR 622.15(b)(3), and the requirements of 6 NYCRR 622.15(b) were adequately met.</p><p>Furthermore, at the hearing conducted on May 12, 2015, Department staff  presented a prima facie case  on the merits, and proved its case by a preponderance of the evidence (see Hearing Report, at 5). Accordingly, staff  is entitled to a judgment based on record evidence.</p><p>In its papers, Department staff  sought a civil penalty  of ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000) (see Staff  Ex. 1, Complaint, at Wherefore Clause P II). At the May 12, 2015 hearing, the ALJ granted staff's  motion to reduce the requested civil penalty  to five thousand dollars ($ 5,000) (see Hearing Report, at 2). Respondent has failed to renew  the registration  of its facility since the registration  expired  on July 1, 2013, and the civil penalty  requested by staff  is authorized and appropriate (see Matter of 12 Martense Associates LLC, Order of the Commissioner, <page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> December 19, 2011, at 2). Respondent is also directed to submit to the Department a petroleum  bulk storage  registration  application for the facility, plus applicable registration  fees, within fifteen (15) days of the service of this order upon it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">NOW, THEREFORE</emphasis>, having considered this matter and being duly advised, it is <emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDERED</emphasis> that:</p><p>I. Department staff's  motion for a default judgment  pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15 is granted. By failing to answer or appear in this proceeding, respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. waived its right to be heard at the hearing.</p><p>II. Moreover, based upon record evidence, respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. is adjudged to have violated ECL 17-1009 and 6 NYCRR 612.2 for failing to renew  the registration  of its petroleum  storage facility  located at 715 West 170th Street, New York, New York on or before July 1, 2013.</p><p>III. Within fifteen (15) days of the service of this order upon respondent, respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. shall submit to the Department a petroleum  bulk storage  registration  application for the facility, plus applicable registration  fees.</p><p>IV. Within fifteen (15) days of the service of this order upon respondent, respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. shall<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> pay a civil penalty  in the amount of five thousand dollars ($ 5,000) by certified check, cashier's check or money order made payable to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p><p>V. The facility petroleum  bulk storage  registration  application, applicable registration  fees, and the penalty payment shall be sent to the following address:</p><p>Office of General Counsel<br/>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation<br/>625 Broadway, 14th Floor<br/>Albany, New York 12233-1500<br/>Attn: Jonathan Barker.</p><p>VI. Any questions or other correspondence regarding this order shall also be addressed to Jonathan Barker at the address referenced in paragraph V of this order.</p><p>VII.

("respondent") was served with a notice of hearing  and complaint, dated January 23, 2015, alleging a violation of ECL 17-1009 and its implementing regulation,  6 NYCRR 612.2, for failure to renew  the registration  for its petroleum  storage facility  located at 715 West 170th Street, New York, New York, on or before July 1, 2013. The complaint seeks an order of the Commissioner (1) finding respondent in violation of ECL 17-1009 and 6 NYCRR 612.2; (2) assessing a civil penalty  in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000); (3) directing respondent to register the petroleum  storage facility  within fifteen (15) days of the service of the Commissioner's order upon respondent, by remitting the registration  fee set forth in ECL 17-1009(2) and a complete registration  application in accordance with 6 NYCRR 612.2; and (4) granting such other and further relief as<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> the Commissioner may deem just and appropriate.</p><p>Inasmuch as respondent is an active domestic business  corporation in the State of New York, service of the notice of hearing  and complaint on respondent was made by serving the New York State Department of State on January 26, 2015 (see Staff  Exhibit ["Staff  Ex."] 2). Respondent was also served with the notice of hearing  and complaint by regular mail on January 26, 2015. Respondent failed to file  an answer to the complaint, and failed to appear at a pre-hearing  conference scheduled  for February 24, 2015, as directed in the cover letter  served with the notice of hearing  and complaint.</p><p>As stated in the notice of hearing,  on March 24, 2015, an adjudicatory hearing  was convened  before Administrative Law  Judge ("ALJ") Richard R. Wissler of the Department of Environmental Conservation's ("Department") Office of Hearings and Mediation Services ("OHMS") at the Department's Region 2 offices, 1 Hunter's Point Plaza, 47-40 21st Street, Long Island City, New York 11101-5407. Department staff  was represented by Deborah Gorman, Esq., Office of General Counsel, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, New York<page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> 12233-1500. No one appeared on behalf of respondent.</p><p>Department staff  indicated that it was prepared to proceed with the hearing, proffering a program staff  witness. Noting for the record that respondent had failed to answer the complaint, failed to appear for the pre-hearing  conference and failed to appear for the adjudicatory hearing,  Department staff  orally  moved for a default judgment  pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15. The ALJ reserved on the default  motion, allowing the record to remain open for Department staff  to submit the documentation required by 6 NYCRR 622.15(b). Moreover, the ALJ noted Department staff's  readiness for hearing and noted the failure of respondent to appear. The ALJ advised that the hearing, in the absence of respondent, would be convened  on a subsequent date.</p><p>On May 12, 2015, the adjudicatory hearing  was convened  before the undersigned ALJ at the Department's Central Office at 625 Broadway, Albany, New York 12233. Department staff  was represented by Deborah Gorman, Esq., an attorney in the Department's Office of General Counsel. Department staff  orally  renewed  its motion for a default judgment,  and also sought judgment on the merits.</p><p>Staff  also made a motion <page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> to amend  the complaint to reduce the requested penalty from ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000) to five thousand dollars ($ 5,000), in accordance with general penalty guidelines as set forth in Matter of 12 Martense Associates LLC, Order of the Commissioner, December 19, 2011, at 2 (civil penalty  of $ 5,000 is appropriate for registration  violations of less than two years' duration). Reduction of the penalty requested in the complaint in this matter does not raise the same due process concerns as would a request to increase the penalty in a default  situation (see Matter of Reliable Heating Oil, Inc., Decision and Order of the Commissioner, October 30, 2013, at 2-3; see also CPLR 3215[b] [default judgment  "shall not exceed in amount … that demanded in the complaint"]), and the requested reduction does not otherwise prejudice respondent. I therefore granted staff's  motion to amend  at the May 12, 2015 hearing (see 6 NYCRR 622.5[b] ["a party may amend its pleading at any time prior to the final decision of the commissioner by permission of the ALJ … and absent prejudice to the ability of any other party to respond"]).</p><p>Department staff  called one witness, Jonathan Barker, paralegal in<page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> the Department's Office of General Counsel's Petroleum  Spill and Bulk Storage  ("PBS") Section. In all, eight (8) exhibits were received in evidence.</p><p>Applicable Regulatory Provision</p><p>Section 612.2. Registration  of facilities.</p><p>(a) <emphasis typeStyle="it">Existing facilities</emphasis>.</p><p>(1) Within one year of the effective date of these regulations,  the owner of any petroleum  storage facility  having a capacity of over 1,100 gallons  must register the facility with the department. This shall include any out-of-service facility which has not been permanently closed.</p><p>(2) Registration  must be renewed  every five years from the date of the last valid registration  until the department receives written notice that the facility has been permanently closed or that ownership of the facility has been transferred.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Findings of Fact</emphasis></p><p>1. Respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. is the owner of a petroleum  storage facility  having a capacity of over 1,100 gallons  located at 715 West 170th Street, New York, New York ("facility"). In particular, petroleum  storage tank number 001 at the facility has a capacity of 4,000 gallons  and is located aboveground (Staff  Ex. 1, Complaint ["Compl."] P 14; see also Staff  Exs. 4, 5, and 6).</p><p>2. Respondent<page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> is an active domestic business  corporation in the State of New York (Staff  Ex. 3).</p><p>3. On July 25, 2008, the Department issued Petroleum  Bulk Storage  ("PBS") Certificate Number 2-601666, renewing the registration  of the PBS facility, to 715 Heights Corp. (Staff  Ex. 4-5). This registration  expired  on July 1, 2013 (Staff  Ex. 5).</p><p>4. Jonathan Barker is a paralegal in the Department's Office of General Counsel's Petroleum  Spill and Bulk Storage  Section who is authorized to access, search and inspect the Department's unified information system ("UIS"). The UIS is a database maintained by the Department that contains petroleum  storage facility  records filed with the Department, which records include petroleum  storage facility  registrations  filed pursuant to 6 NYCRR 612.2 (Testimony of Jonathan Barker).</p><p>5. On May 4, 2015, Jonathan Barker searched the petroleum  storage facility  records contained in the Department's UIS database for any petroleum  facility registration  or renewal registration  or any petroleum  storage facility  re-registration filed by respondent for the facility (Testimony of Jonathan Barker).</p><p>6. As a result of his searches, Jonathan Barker determined that respondent had<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 23"/> not renewed  the registration  of the facility at any time after the PBS certificate expired  on July 1, 2013 (Testimony of Jonathan Barker).</p><p>7. As shown by Receipt for Service No. 201501300400 issued by the New York State Department of State, respondent was served on January 26, 2015, pursuant to section 306 of the Business Corporation Law with a notice of hearing  and complaint dated January 23, 2015, alleging a violation of ECL 17-1009 and its implementing regulation,  6 NYCRR 612.2, for failure to renew  the registration  of its petroleum  storage facility  located at 715 West 170th Street, New York, New York, on or before July 1, 2013.

A respondent's failure to file a timely answer "constitutes a default  and a waiver of respondent's right to a hearing" (6 NYCRR 622.15[a]).

Martens, Commissioner</p><p>DECISION OF THE COMMISSIONER</p><p>The Town and Village  of Harrison ("Harrison" or "applicant") proposes to develop a brownfield remediation  site  in Harrison ("Project Home Run" or "project"), and has applied for a consolidated permit pursuant to ECL articles 17 and 24, implementing regulations,  and Clean Water Act § 401. The project has twice been reduced significantly in scope. The initial version of the project, according to the 2007 completed application, included a full baseball and softball stadium, youth soccer and multipurpose field, children's playground, parking lots, and associated infrastructure (see <url normalizedValue="http://www.dec.ny.gov/enb/35816.html">http://www.dec.ny.gov/enb/35816.html</url>, Notice of Legislative Public Hearing and Issues Conference, dated June 20, 2007). That version of the project would have involvedfilling  and grading  approximately 0.39 acre  of a Class II freshwater  wetland  ("FWW J-3") and 1.7 acres  of the wetland's  100-foot adjacent  area (see Matter of Town/Village  of Harrison, Rulings on Issues and Party Status, May 29, 2009 ["May 2009 Rulings"], at 2; see also Affidavit of Thomas J. Fucillo, Esq. dated January 13, 2015 ["Fucillo Aff."], Exhibit ["Ex."] 4, Document<page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> ["Doc."] 4 [Amended Negative Declaration  dated August 7, 2014], at 1).</p><p>In 2009 and 2010, Harrison revised  and reduced the size of the project, resulting in plans for a "pick-up ball field, an open grass area, a walking trail that loops around the property and connects to the existing wood plank river walk and two gravel parking areas" (see Matter of Town/Village  of Harrison, Supplemental Rulings on Issues for Adjudication, July 15, 2011 ["July 2011 Supplemental Rulings"]; see also Beaver Swamp Brook Project Home Run SEQRA Negative Declaration  Update [Jan. 21, 2011]). That iteration of the project included filling  and grading  approximately 0.162 acre  of FWW J-3 and 2.0 acres  of the wetland's  adjacent  area.</p><p>Following a legislative hearing and issues conference, Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") Daniel P. O'Connell issued three rulings regarding the second proposed project: (i) the May 2009 Rulings; (ii) an August 21, 2009 Ruling on SEQRA Compliance ("August 2009 SEQRA Ruling"); and (iii) the July 2011 Supplemental Rulings. In 2011, intervenors  City of Rye ("Rye") and Douglas Schaper appealed from the ALJ's May 2009 Rulings and July 2011 Supplemental Rulings.</p><p>On June 12, 2013, I<page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> issued an Interim Decision ("Interim Decision") affirming the ALJ's rulings, and remanded the matter for adjudication of whether the project as it then existed satisfied the "weighing  standards" set forth at 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(2), applicable to projects involving placing fill in, and grading,  a regulated wetland  (see Interim Decision, at 9-10). <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_11_147_331"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> In the Interim Decision, I also: (i) affirmed the ALJ holding that Harrison's SEQRA determination is beyond the scope of this proceeding (see Interim Decision, at 7); and (ii) held that Department staff's  SEQRA negative declaration  was not irrational (see id. at 6-7).</p></bodyText></footnote> In November 2013, at the parties' request, the matter was referred to mediation. Although the mediation efforts were productive in narrowing the issues, they did not result in a complete resolution or settlement of the matter. <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_11_147_295"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> According to Harrison, during the mediation, Department staff  and Harrison discussed ways to further reduce direct impacts to the wetland,  and ultimately agreed to reposition the project so it would have no direct impacts on the wetland  (see Fucillo Aff. P 3). Although informed of the reduction in the scope of the project, Rye and Mr. Schaper declined to withdraw their opposition (see id.).</p></bodyText></footnote> In August 2014, the parties requested that the ALJ schedule the adjudicatory hearing. </p><p><page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/><br/>On or about August 19, 2014, Harrison filed a joint permit application and supporting documents relating to modification of the proposed freshwater  wetlands  permit, and reflecting a further modification and reduction of the project ("August 2014 Project"). The August 2014 Project no longer involves any filling  or grading  activities in FWW J-3. Filling  and grading  activities would be limited to 2.0 acres  of the wetland's  adjacent  area. In addition, the August 2014 Project includes a 1.07 acre  wetland  buffer enhancement plan to mitigate impacts on the adjacent  area, comprised of removing all invasive plant  species and replacing them with a combination of native plants  and a seed mix to provide a vegetated buffer to the wetlands  (see Matter of Town/Village  of Harrison, Further Proceedings and Draft Scheduling Order, dated October 31, 2014 ["October 2014 Ruling"], at 2).</p><p>By email dated September 16, 2014, Department staff  provided to the parties and to the ALJ copies of a Notice of Complete Application ("NOCA"), a SEQRA determination concerning the August 2014 Project, and a draft permit. Staff  published the NOCA in the September 17, 2014 <emphasis typeStyle="it">Environmental  Notice Bulletin</emphasis>, and applicant<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> published the NOCA in the <emphasis typeStyle="it">Journal News</emphasis>. The NOCA provided a 15-day public comment period. No comments were received.</p><p>By letter dated October 3, 2014 ("Appl. Oct. 2014 Letter"), Harrison notified the ALJ that it did not object to any of the conditions in the draft permit and, based upon the reduction in scope of the project, requested that the adjudicatory hearing  be canceled as moot. Following receipt and review of the comments provided by the parties, the ALJ ruled that an adjudicatory hearing  was necessary to determine whether the August 2014 Project would meet the three compatibility  tests set forth in 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(1) (see October 2014 Ruling, at 7). <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_16_254_135"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> Harrison and Department staff  had also asserted to the ALJ that the activities associated with the August 2014 Project are "insignificant  enough to be compatible"  (see October 2014 Ruling at 7; see also 6 NYCRR 663.4[d] [in some cases, a proposed action that is otherwise characterized as "usually incompatible"  with a wetland  and its functions or benefits "may be insignificant  enough to be compatible" ]).</p></bodyText></footnote> The ALJ also ruled that, "[i]f Harrison cannot demonstrate compatibility,  then the weighing  standards outlined at 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(2) must be adequately addressed in order to obtain a permit" (id.). The ALJ further held that "the parties will have the opportunity [at the hearing] to develop a record about whether the [August 2014 Project] would meet the weighing  standards … for a Class II wetland"  (id.).</p><p><page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/><br/>In his October 2014 Ruling, the ALJ also granted to staff  and applicant an opportunity to respond to Rye's and Mr. Schaper's objections to Department staff's  September 2014 SEQRA amended negative declaration  (see id. at 8-9). Following receipt of those responses, the ALJ ruled that staff's  September 2014 negative declaration  "is rational and not otherwise affected by an error of law, " and that staff  "took the required hard look  at potential environmental  impacts of the [August 2014 Project], and provided a reasoned elaboration  for the negative declaration"  (Issues Ruling on Department Staff's  September 15, 2014 Negative Declaration  and Appeal's Schedule, dated December 9, 2014 ["December 2014 Ruling"], at 5). The ALJ held that the environmental  review of the August 2014 Project was complete (see id.).</p><p>Applicant and Department staff  appeal from the ALJ's October 2014 Ruling holding that an adjudicatory hearing  is necessary (see Expedited Appeal, dated January 13, 2015 ["Harrison App."]; Appeal, undated ["Staff  App."]). Rye appeals from the ALJ's December 2014 Ruling regarding SEQRA (see Rye Expedited Appeal, dated January 15, 2015 ["Rye App."]). <footnote><anchor id="fnote4_19_349_172"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p> Although Rye states that it is also appealing from certain rulings contained in the October 2014 Ruling, it provides no argument on any issue specific to that Ruling, and expressly states that "the City is not appealing that portion of ALJ O'Connell's October 2014 Ruling finding that there were still issues that should proceed to the adjudicatory hearing  stage" (Rye App. at 1).</p></bodyText></footnote> Mr. Schaper has filed a "reply<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

As discussed below, the ALJ correctly held that staff  took the requisite hard look  at the August 2014 Project under SEQRA, and staff's  negative declaration  is rational and not affected by an error of law.  I do not concur with the ALJ's ruling that an adjudicatory hearing  is necessary to determine whether the August 2014 Project meets the compatibility  tests set forth in 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(1), and that the parties should have an opportunity to develop a record concerning whether the August 2014<page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> Project would meet the weighing  standards set forth at 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(2).</p><p>DISCUSSION</p><p>A. Harrison's and Staff's  Appeals</p><p>In its appeal, Harrison requests a determination that no issues for adjudication remain, and a direction that the adjudicatory hearing  be canceled in accordance with 6 NYCRR 624.4(c)(5) (see Harrison App., at 2, 23). Harrison argues that the sole issue identified for adjudication in my June 2013 Interim Decision - whether the project satisfied the weighing  standards - is no longer applicable because the August 2014 Project does not involve any direct impacts to the wetland  (see id. at 12-13). Harrison also argues that it has demonstrated that the August 2014 Project meets each of the three compatibility  tests set forth at 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(1) (id. at 13-16). Finally, Harrison argues that intervenors  Rye and Schaper have not satisfied their burden of establishing that any substantive and significant issues require adjudication, and that the ALJ erred in finding issues for adjudication (id. at 16-23). Staff  has filed its own appeal, joining and agreeing with Harrison's position and requesting that I overturn the ALJ's October 2014 Ruling. I address the parties' arguments<page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> below.</p><p>1. The Compatibility  and Weighing  Standards</p><p>As set forth above, the earlier versions of the proposed project included filling  and grading  activities in both FWW J-3 and its adjacent  area. Department regulations  characterize filling  and grading  within a freshwater  wetland  as "P(X)," "P" denoting an activity requiring a permit, and "X" characterizing the activity as "incompatible, " which means "incompatible  with a wetland  and its functions and benefits" (6 NYCRR 663.4[d]; see also id., Activities Chart, Items 20 [filling]  and 25 [grading] ). Proposed activities that the regulations  characterize as "incompatible"  must always meet the "weighing  standards" in order to be permitted (see 6 NYCRR 663.5[e][2]; 6 NYCRR 663.5[d][2]).</p><p>Department regulations  characterize filling  and grading  activities within a wetland  adjacent  area as "P(N)," "P" again denoting an activity requiring a permit, and "N" characterizing the activity as "usually incompatible, " which means "usually incompatible  with a wetland  and its functions or benefits, although in some cases the proposed action may be insignificant  enough to be compatible"  (6 NYCRR 663.4[d]; see also id., Activities Chart, Items 20 [filling] <page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> and 25 [grading] ).</p><p>Filling  and grading  activities in a wetland  adjacent  area may be permitted if they meet the three tests for compatibility  or, as set forth above, are "insignificant  enough" to be considered compatible  (see 6 NYCRR 663.5[d]; 6 NYCRR 663.5[e]). An activity satisfies the three tests for compatibility  where it (i) would be compatible  with the preservation, protection and conservation of the wetland  and its benefits; (ii) would result in no more than insubstantial degradation to, or loss of, any part of the wetland;  and (iii) would be compatible  with public health  and welfare (see 6 NYCRR 663.5[e][1][i]-[iii]).</p><p>Where proposed activities in a wetlands  adjacent  area meet the three tests for compatibility,  "no other weighing  standards need apply, regardless of the wetland's  classification, and a permit, with or without conditions, may be issued for the proposed activity" (6 NYCRR 663.5[d][1]; see also 6 NYCRR 663.5[e][1] [if all three compatibility  tests are met, "no other weighing  standards need be met, regardless of the wetland  class"]). Thus, the "weighing  standards" are not applicable where activities denoted "P(N)" meet the compatibility  tests. If a proposed activity<page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> does not satisfy all three tests of compatibility,  however, it must meet each of the "weighing  standards" applicable to the particular class of wetland  affected (see 6 NYCRR 663.5[d][2]; 6 NYCRR 663.5[e]).</p><p>An applicant bears the burden of demonstrating compliance with permit requirements and the regulations  (see 6 NYCRR 663.5[a]). The discussion below addresses first Harrison's and Department staff's  submissions regarding whether the August 2014 Project meets the compatibility  tests. I will then address whether Rye or Mr. Schaper have raised any substantive and significant issues warranting an adjudicatory hearing. </p><p>2. The August 2014 Project and Applicable Standards</p><p>As set forth above, the August 2014 Project no longer involves any activities within a freshwater  wetland,  and involves only grading  and filling  activities within 2.0 acres  of the wetland's  adjacent  area (see Fucillo Aff. Ex. 4, Doc. 4, at 1). Under the regulations,  these activities are considered "P(N)" (see discussion above). If the activities meet the three compatibility  tests, or are "insignificant  enough" to be considered compatible,  the weighing  standards need not be reached or applied, and a permit may be issued<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> for the project (see 6 NYCRR 663.5[d][1]; 6 NYCRR 663.5[e][1]).</p><p>Both before the ALJ and on this appeal, Harrison has argued that the August 2014 Project meets each of the three compatibility  tests. With respect to the first compatibility  test, Harrison states that the August 2014 Project is compatible  with the preservation, protection and conservation of the wetland  and its benefits for the following reasons: (i) the project has been redesigned to eliminate all regulated activities in the wetland;  (ii) retention of the pond that is part of the mapped wetlands  will promote the passive recreational enjoyment of the wetland  by providing public open space and access to a restored wetland  in an urbanized area; and (iii) the wetland  and its adjacent  area will benefit from the project's mitigation  plan, which includes removing invasive plant  species and planting native species on 1.07 acres  (see Fucillo Aff. Ex. 4 [Application Document No. 7, Letter from Evans Associates dated July 31, 2014, attaching Project Narrative ("Evans Submission")]; see id. Ex. 8 [Appl. Oct. 2014 Letter], at 3-4; see also Harrison App. at 13-16).</p><p>Department staff  agrees with Harrison, stating that the wetland <page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> would be preserved because the August 2014 Project will involve no direct impact on the wetland.  Department staff  also describes the mitigation,  referred to as a "buffer enhancement plan," which involves the planting of native plants  (primarily trees and shrubs) (see Affidavit of Heather Gierloff in Support of Expedited Appeal, dated January 15, 2015 ["Gierloff Aff."], P 9[i]; see also Staff  App. at 6 [same]). According to Ms. Gierloff, these plantings will increase the complexity of the root systems on site,  thereby enhancing habitat, and will provide filtration and soil stability "for both potential water level increases in the wetland  and over-land flow of runoff to the wetland"  (Gierloff Aff. P 9[i]). Ms. Gierloff states further that the engineering plans submitted by Harrison reflect a post-project increase in flood  storage  volume (id. P 9[ii]). Thus, the project would not only preserve, protect and conserve the wetland,  but would actually increase one of its primary benefits.</p><p>With respect to the second compatibility  test - whether the project will result in no more than insubstantial degradation to, or loss of, any part of the wetland  - Harrison and Department staff  state <page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> that, because the project no longer involves direct activities in the wetland,  no loss of any part of the wetland  will occur (see Appl. Oct. 2014 Letter, at 3-4 [no direct wetlands  impact]; Evans Submission, at 3 [elimination of filling  of on-site pond, which is part of the wetland,  means that the second compatibility  test has been met]; see also Gierloff Aff. P 9[ii]). In addition, although the August 2014 Project involves grading  and filling  within the wetland  adjacent  area, Harrison and staff  argue that the proposed mitigation  plan "will more than off-set the minimal disturbance to the Adjacent  Area" (Appl. Oct. 2014 Letter, at 3; see also Staff  App., at 6-7 [although the project includes some impervious surface, run off is controlled with a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and final grading  will result in larger land area for flood  attenuation]; Gierloff Aff. P 9[ii] [project results in increase in flood  storage  volume]).</p><p>To meet the third compatibility  test, the project must be compatible  with the public health  and welfare. Harrison argues that the project will provide "much needed athletic fields and recreational facilities," and will promote recreational enjoyment of the<page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/>  wetland  by providing public open space and walking paths providing access to the wetland  (see Appl. Oct. 2014 Letter, at 4). Staff  agrees with Harrison's argument, and states further that the August 2014 Project does not propose any actions that would be incompatible  with public health  and welfare, such as industrial activities, or storage  or manufacturing of petroleum or other products that could impact the wetland  (see Staff  App., at 7).</p><p>3. Intervenors'  Positions With Respect to the August 2014 Project</p><p>Following the receipt and review of materials relating to the August 2014 Project, and the revised  draft permit, Rye and Mr. Schaper filed and served their opposition papers (see Fucillo Aff. Exs. 9 [Letter from Rye Corporation Counsel to ALJ dated October 10, 2014 ("Rye 2014 Letter")] and 10 [Comment on Permit Application by Douglas B. Schaper dated September 17, 2014]). The ALJ thereafter held that an adjudicatory hearing  would be required with respect to whether the August 2014 Project meets the compatibility  tests, stating only that Rye and Schaper "disagree" with the positions of Harrison and Department staff  (see October 2014 Ruling, at 7). The ALJ held that the parties "will<page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> have the opportunity [at the adjudicatory hearing]  to develop a record about whether the [August 2014 Project] would meet the weighing  standards outlined at 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(2) for a Class II wetland  (id.). The ALJ did not refer to any specific documents or other evidence submitted by either Rye or Mr. Schaper to support their "disagreement" with Harrison and staff. </p><p>In response to the current appeals by Harrison and Department staff,  Rye argues that its wetlands  consultant  has raised "substantive and significant <emphasis typeStyle="it">concerns</emphasis> regarding the ability of Harrison to meet these Compatibility  Standards" (Opposition to Town/Village  of Harrison and Department of Environmental  Conservation Region III Stafff's [sic] Expedited Appeals ["Rye Opp."], at 5) (italics added). Rye refers generally to two documents prepared by its consultant,  but provides no specific page citations or quotes from these documents to support its argument (see Rye Opp. Ex. 2 [February 23, 2009 document entitled "Response to January 20, 2009 DEC Staff  Statement" ("2009 Response"), and November 3, 2008 document entitled "Justification to Deny NYS DEC Freshwater  Wetland  Permit Application" ("2008 Justification Doc.")]).<br/><page number="17" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/><br/>On their face, neither of the documents prepared by Rye's consultant  addresses the August 2014 Project. Both documents discuss the earlier remediation  of the site  and an earlier version of the project (see e.g. 2009 Response at 7-8 [discussing freshwater  wetlands  permit requirements concerning the "Remediation  and Redevelopment projects," and SEQRA issues]; 2008 Justification Doc. at 7-12 [discussion of wetlands  permit requirements relating to the "Remediation  and Redevelopment Projects" and the purported failure of the activities of the Remediation  and Redevelopment projects to satisfy the weighing  standards]).</p><p>The August 2014 Project reflects elimination of direct impacts to the wetland;  this addresses concerns raised in Rye's initial offer of proof, including the submissions by Rye's consultant.  Rye's submissions are insufficient to establish that a substantive and significant issue exists requiring adjudication of whether the August 2014 Project meets the compatibility  tests (see 6 NYCRR § 624.4[c][4] [potential party has burden of persuasion to provide an appropriate offer of proof that supports its proposed issues]; 6 NYCRR 624.5[b][2][ii] [offer of proof must "specify[] <page number="18" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> the witness(es), the nature of the evidence the person expects to present and the grounds upon which the assertion is made with respect to that issue"]; see also Matter of Akzo Nobel Salt Inc., Interim Decision of Commissioner, January 31, 1996, at 12 [no adjudicatory hearing  necessary where revised  permit conditions address intervenors'  offers of proof]).</p><p>In his submission responding to Harrison's and staff's  appeals, Mr. Schaper argues that, absent an "independent" scientific analysis of the soils at the site,  it is impossible to determine "the site's  ability to mitigate flooding" (Letter to parties dated January 29, 2015 ["Schaper Letter"], at 1). Mr. Schaper also continues to argue that the earlier remediation  of the site  has "erased" the wetlands,  and that the proposed project is not in the best interests of the people in the relevant communities (see id. at 1-2). As set forth in prior decisions and rulings, however, the earlier remediation  of the site  is not the subject of this proceeding (see Interim Decision at 3 n 5 [citing May 2009 Rulings at 52]). Mr. Schaper has not satisfied the burden to demonstrate that a substantive and significant issue exists requiring adjudication<page number="19" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> (see e.g. Matter of Halfmoon Water Improvement Area No. 1, Decision of the Commissioner, March 3, 1982, at 2 [conclusory statements are not sufficient to raise an adjudicable issue, and a potential party's assertions "should arise from the opinions of the expert or other qualified witnesses"]; see also Matter of Seneca Meadows, Inc., Interim Decision of the Commissioner, October 26, 2012, at 4 [assertions by potential party "must have a factual or scientific foundation. Speculation, expressions of concern, general criticisms, or conclusory statements are insufficient to raise an adjudicable issue."]).</p><p>The submissions of Harrison and staff  demonstrate that the revised,  much-reduced August 2014 Project meets each of the three compatibility  tests set forth in the regulations. </p><p>With respect to the first compatibility  test, I agree with Harrison and staff  that elimination of the filling  and grading  activities in the wetland  preserves, protects and conserves the wetland  and its benefits. Moreover, the mitigation  plan to remove invasive plant  species and to plant  native trees and shrubs on 1.07 acres  will enhance the wetland  and its adjacent  area by improving habitat, soil stability and<page number="20" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> flood  storage  capacity.</p><p>With respect to the second compatibility  test, the August 2014 Project involves no loss of wetland,  and the wetland  buffer enhancement plan will serve to improve, rather than degrade, the wetland  and its adjacent  area. Finally, with respect to the third compatibility  test, I find that the August 2014 Project will be compatible  with the public health  and welfare, by promoting recreational enjoyment of the wetland,  and providing athletic fields and walking paths.</p><p>Neither Rye nor Mr. Schaper has raised a substantive and significant issue with respect to the August 2014 Project and any of the compatibility  tests, and I do not concur with the ALJ's holding that the intervenors'  "disagreement" with Harrison, or their "concerns," without more, are sufficient to warrant an adjudicatory hearing. Because the compatibility  tests are satisfied, the weighing  standards need not be reached.</p><p>B. Rye's Appeal</p><p>After reviewing Harrison's August 2014 Project which, as discussed above, modified Project Home Run to eliminate direct impacts on FWW J-3, Department staff  issued an Amended Negative Declaration  dated September 15, 2014 ("Amended Neg. Dec.") (see Rye App. Ex. 3). <page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> In the Amended Neg. Dec., staff  stated that it had reviewed the project for potential impacts to land, surface water, groundwater, air, traffic, noise, visual and cultural resources (see id.). Staff  determined that the August 2014 Project "is a lower impact alternative to a project that has previously been determined not to have a significant adverse impact on the environment" (id.).</p><p>Following receipt and review of the Amended Neg. Dec., a Notice of Complete Application and a revised  draft permit, Rye and Mr. Schaper filed letters with the ALJ, and Harrison and staff  responded (see December 2014 Ruling at 1). The ALJ thereafter conducted a thorough review of the Amended Neg. Dec. and the parties' filings, and concluded that the Amended Neg. Dec. was rational and not otherwise affected by an error of law,  and that staff  took the required hard look  at potential environmental  impacts of the August 2014 Projects and provided a reasoned elaboration  for the negative declaration  (see id. at 5).</p><p>In its appeal, Rye argues that, "simply because the [August 2014 Project] removes one component of the project, it does not mean that there are not remaining significant adverse environmental  impacts<page number="22" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> necessitating a draft environmental  impact statement" (Rye App. at 2-3). Rye then argues that the Amended Neg. Dec. is "conclusory," and that the Amended Neg. Dec. relied improperly upon staff's  prior negative declaration  in July 2011 and Harrison's 2004 negative declaration  (see id. at 4). Rye then argues that staff's  July 2011 negative declaration  was inadequate with respect to flood  storage  capacity, and that the ALJ's July 2011 Supplemental Rulings was in error (see id. at 6-7). Rye requests that I (i) consider <emphasis typeStyle="it">Harrison's</emphasis> August 2014 Amended Negative Declaration  to be within the scope of these proceedings and find that it is arbitrary and capricious; and (ii) "annul" the ALJ's December 2014 Ruling upholding staff's  Amended Neg. Dec. (see id. at 8).</p><p>In its response to Rye's appeal, staff  points out that, because the August 2014 Project reflects a change in a prior project that had been fully reviewed under SEQRA, staff  could have limited its review to only the changes in the August 2014 Project (see Response to City of Rye's Expedited Appeal, undated ["Staff  Resp."], at 2 [citing 6 NYCRR 617.7(e)(1)(iii)]). <footnote><anchor id="fnote5_50_1207_123"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p> Section 617.7(e)(1)(iii) provides as follows:</p><p>At any time prior to its decision to undertake, fund or approve an action, a lead agency, at its discretion, may amend a negative declaration  when substantive … changes in circumstances related to the project arise; that were not previously considered and the lead agency determines that no significant adverse environmental  impacts will occur.</p></bodyText></footnote> Rather than limit its review to the changes in the project, however, <page number="23" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/>staff  reviewed the entire project, and describes that review in detail (see Staff  Resp. at 2-4).</p><p>Harrison agrees that staff's  review could have been limited to the changes in the project, but that staff  went further and reviewed the entire project (see Response to City of Rye's Expedited Appeal, dated January 27, 2015 ["Harrison Resp."], at 4). Harrison also points out that many of Rye's arguments were raised, and rejected, in the June 2013 Interim Decision affirming the negative declaration  relating to the earlier version of the project (see id. at 6).</p><p>I agree with the ALJ's thorough analysis of the parties' arguments relating to staff's  SEQRA review of the August 2014 Project. Therefore, upon review of the record and giving due consideration to intervenors'  objections to Department<page number="24" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> staff's  amended negative declaration,  I conclude that Department staff  took the requisite "hard look, " and presented a reasoned elaboration  in support of its negative declaration  (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="85 N.Y.2d 382,at 396"><content>Matter of Chemical Specialties Mfrs. Assoc. v Jorling, <span normalizedCite="85 N.Y.2d 382">85 NY2d 382<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000085#000382#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="85 N.Y.2d 382">396-397<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000085#000382#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1995]). Accordingly, I affirm the ALJ's determination that Department staff's  amended negative declaration  was not irrational or affected by any error of law  (see 6 NYCRR 624.4[c][6][i][<emphasis typeStyle="it">a</emphasis>]).</p><p>In the "Conclusion" section of its appeal, Rye requests that I also review, and invalidate, Harrison's amended negative declaration  (see Rye App. at 8). As I held in the Interim Decision, Harrison's SEQRA review is beyond the scope of this proceeding, and I affirm the ALJ's ruling in that regard (see Interim Decision, at 7 [citing May 2009 Rulings, at 43, further citing 6 NYCRR 624.4(c)(6)(ii)(<emphasis typeStyle="it">a</emphasis>)]; see also December 2014 Ruling, at 5 [ALJ ruling that Harrison's August 2014 amended negative declaration  is beyond the scope of this proceeding]).</p><p>To the extent that other issues have been raised, these have been considered and are lacking in merit.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>I hereby reverse the ALJ's ruling that an adjudicatory <page number="25" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 24"/> hearing  is necessary with respect to whether the August 2014 Project meets the compatibility  tests set forth in 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(1). Because the project satisfies all three of the compatibility  tests, the weighing  standards set forth at 6 NYCRR 663.5(e)(2) need not be addressed, and a permit may be issued (see 6 NYCRR 663.5[d][1], [e][1]).</p><p>I hereby affirm the ALJ's ruling that staff's  September 15, 2014 amended negative declaration  is not irrational or otherwise affected by an error of law,  and that staff  took the requisite "hard look"  and presented a reasoned elaboration  in support of its amended negative declaration. </p><p>This matter is hereby remanded to Department staff  to issue the consolidated permit, a draft of which was provided to the ALJ on September 16, 2014.</p></bodyText></decisionOpinion></opinions></administrativeDecision></administrativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5GCV-BKC0-003Y-J0V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">5479</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2015-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><paginationScheme pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Kincade is alleged to have maintained an unpermitted dock  and steps, and cut, removed, injured, or destroyed trees and other vegetation  on State forest preserve  lands adjoining the Stillwater Reservoir  in the Town of Webb, Herkimer County. The State forest preserve  lands at issue are located to the east of respondent's property and include an upland parcel  of land between the eastern boundary of respondent's property and the shore  of the Stillwater Reservoir,  and lands below the mean high water  level of and submerged under the reservoir  (see Map  [10-25-06], Contino Affidavit [Affid], <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_8_89_60"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> The Contino Affidavit is located at Exhibit G to the Department's Attorney Brief.</p></bodyText></footnote> Exhibit [Exh] 1).</p><p>Staff  of the Department of Environmental Conservation (Department) commenced this proceeding by service of a notice of hearing and complaint dated December 15, 2006 (see Department Attorney Brief, Exh B).

ENV LEXIS 21"/><br/>Respondent, appearing pro se, filed an answer dated January 1, 2007, in which he pleaded not guilty to the three charges (see Contino Affid, Exh 22). Respondent also raised various defenses, including his claim that as a riparian land owner, he has the right to wharf out to the navigable waters of the Stillwater Reservoir.  Respondent also claimed he has approval for the steps and dock  from the Hudson River-Black River  Regulating District.</p><p>Department staff  subsequently filed a motion for order without hearing dated July 30, 2008 (see Department Attorney Brief, Exh A).The motion sets forth the following four causes of action:</p><p>(1) that at various times between May 25, 2001 and August 24, 2007, respondent violated ECL 9-0303(1) by cutting, removing, injuring or destroying trees or other property on State land without authorization; </p><p>(2) that between at least June 30, 2003 and at least August 30, 2007, respondent violated ECL 9-0303(2) by maintaining a floating dock  and ramp  over submerged State lands and attaching the dock  to State lands;</p><p>(3) that between at least the fall of 2003 and July 30, 2008, respondent violated ECL 9-0303(2) by maintaining stone  steps from his property<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> to the shore  of Stillwater Reservoir,  across State lands; and</p><p>(4) that between at least June 30, 2003 and at least August 30, 2007, respondent violated ECL 9 0301(1) by maintaining a floating dock  and ramp  over submerged State lands and attaching the dock  to State lands, thereby restricting the free use  of such lands by all the people.</p><p>By its motion, Department staff  requested that the Commissioner issue an order holding respondent liable for the violations enumerated above and assessing a $ 1,000 penalty, $ 750 of which to be suspended provided that respondent complies with the corrective measures that staff  recommended that included the removal of the floating dock  and the stone  steps.</p><p>Respondent filed a response to the motion dated October 3, 2008. The matter was assigned to Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Richard A. Sherman, who adjourned the proceeding pending settlement negotiations between the parties. When negotiations failed to produce a settlement, the ALJ prepared the attached summary report. In the report, the ALJ recommends that Department staff's  motion for order without hearing be granted, and that respondent be held liable for the violations charged in the motion. <page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> The ALJ further recommends that respondent be assessed a civil penalty in the amount of $ 400, with the entire amount suspended provided respondent removes the floating dock  and stone  steps from State land.</p><p>For the reasons that follow, I adopt the ALJ's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations subject to my comments below.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">I. Summary Judgment  on Unpleaded Causes of Action</emphasis></p><p>As an initial matter, the operative pleadings in this matter require clarification. As noted by the ALJ (see Hearing Report, at 1 n 1), the charges against respondent as described in Department staff's  motion for order without hearing differ from those pleaded in the complaint (compare Motion for Order Without Hearing [7-30-08] with Complaint, Department Attorney Brief, Exh B). Specifically, in the motion, Department staff  increased the time periods for the three charges pleaded in the complaint. Staff  also added a new specification for the alleged violation of ECL 9-0303(2), namely, that between at least June 30, 2003, and at least August 30, 2007, respondent violated ECL 9-0303(2) by allegedly fastening a dock  to State forest preserve  lands by means of stakes and a ramp,  without permission <page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> from the Department. Also, Department staff  added a second case number (VISTA Index No. CO6-20080331-9) to the motion, in addition to the number appearing on the complaint (VISTA Index No. CO6-20061107-24). Department staff  made these changes without express notice to respondent that the complaint was being modified by the motion, and without seeking permission  from the ALJ or the Commissioner prior to making the changes.</p><p>The Department Uniform Enforcement Hearing Procedures (see 6 NYCRR part 622) authorize Department staff  to commence an enforcement proceeding by service of a motion for order without hearing in lieu of or in addition to a complaint (see 6 NYCRR 622.12[a]). When the motion is served in lieu of the complaint, Department staff  is required to plead all of its causes of action in the motion, and the motion serves as the complaint in the proceeding.</p><p>Where, as in this case, a motion for order without hearing is served in addition to a complaint, the motion for order without hearing is the administrative equivalent of a motion for summary judgment  on the previously served complaint (see 6 NYCRR 622.12[d] [a contested motion for order without hearing will be granted if<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> the cause of action  is established sufficiently to warrant granting summary judgment  under the CPLR in favor of any party]).</p><p>The general rule is that summary judgment  may not be granted on causes of action not pleaded in the complaint (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="254 A.D.2d 165,at 166"><content>Weinstock v Handler, <span normalizedCite="254 A.D.2d 165">254 AD2d 165<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000254#000165#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="254 A.D.2d 165">166<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#239#3#000254#000165#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1st Dept 1998]). However, a tribunal may award summary judgment  on an unpleaded cause of action  upon a finding that (1) the proof supports the unpleaded cause of action,  and (2) the opposing party has not been misled to its prejudice (see id. ; see also <citation type="case" normalizedCite="226 A.D.2d 1138,at 1139"><content>Home Sav. of Am., FSB v Coconut Is.

In this case, Department staff  alleged sufficient facts in the complaint to place respondent on notice of a possible cause of action for a second violation of ECL 9-0303(2) arising from the alleged fastening of the dock  to State lands by means of stakes and a ramp.  Moreover, Department staff  expressly raised the additional cause of action  in its motion, and the proof submitted on the motion supports the additional cause of action  (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="50 A.D.3d 1587,at 1588"><content>Boyle v Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., <span normalizedCite="50 A.D.3d 1587">50 AD3d 1587<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000050#001587#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="50 A.D.3d 1587">1588<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000050#001587#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation><page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Staff's  proof also supports the additional time frames alleged in the motion for the remaining causes of action. Respondent had a full opportunity to challenge staff's  charges as modified by the motion, and review of respondent's submissions reveals that respondent was aware of the charges and the relief requested by staff  (see id.). Accordingly, respondent would not be prejudiced by an award of summary judgment  on the causes of action as pleaded in the motion.</p><p>Although summary judgment  may be awarded in this case on the unpleaded claims, staff  should not adopt this practice in future cases. The Department's regulations contain certain procedural safeguards that should be observed when, as in this case, staff  seeks to modify the charges after an answer has been served. For example, after the time to answer the complaint has expired, Department staff  may make a motion on notice to the respondent, seeking permission  from the ALJ or the Commissioner to amend the complaint (see 6 NYCRR 622.5[b]). Similarly, where the proceeding is commenced by motion for order without hearing in lieu of complaint, and the time to <page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> respond to the motion has expired, the charges in the motion may also be amended on notice to the respondent and by leave of the ALJ or Commissioner (see Matter of White, Order of the Commissioner, Aug. 13, 2008, at 1-2). Department staff  may also move to conform the pleadings to the proof, again, on notice to the respondent and by permission  of the ALJ or Commissioner (see Matter of Wilder, ALJ Hearing Report, at 3-4, adopted by Order of the Acting Commissioner, Sept. 27, 2005).</p><p>In consideration of the foregoing, in the future whenever Department staff  moves for an order without hearing on charges that differ from those charged in a previously filed complaint in that proceeding, staff  is expected to follow the same procedures that are required for amending a complaint.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">II. Violations</emphasis></p><p>I agree with the ALJ that Department staff  established its entitlement to summary judgment  on the issue of respondent's liability for the four causes of action alleged in the motion (see 6 NYCRR 622.12[d]; Matter of Locaparra, Decision and Order of the Commissioner, June 16, 2003, at 3-4). The use restrictions Department staff  alleges respondent violated in the four causes of action apply to the<page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> forest preserve  lands within the Adirondack Park (see ECL 9-0301; ECL 9-0303). The "forest preserve"  is defined as "the lands owned or hereafter acquired by the state" in the forest preserve  counties, including Herkimer County (ECL 9-0101[6]). The "Adirondack Park" is defined as "all lands located in the forest preserve  counties of the Adirondacks" within certain boundaries described in the statute (ECL 9-0101[1]).</p><p>Respondent does not dispute that the subject parcel  is owned by the State. He argues, however, that the State-owned parcel  is not "forest preserve"  land. In addition, respondent asserts that he has approval for the steps and dock  pursuant to a letter from the HRBRRD to his father, Chet Kincade, dated June 23, 2003 (see Letter from Craig Kincade to James McClymonds, Chief Administrative Law Judge [10-3-08], Exh 6).</p><p>As noted by the ALJ, in 1908, the New York State Court of Appeals decided <citation type="case" normalizedCite="190 N.Y. 468"><content>People v Fisher (<span normalizedCite="190 N.Y. 468">190 NY 468<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#36#3#000190#000468#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>)</content></citation> addressing the Forest,  Fish and Game Commission's jurisdiction over State lands acquired for the Stillwater Reservoir  (see Hearing Report, at 8-9). The Commission had commenced an action pursuant to the Forest,  Fish and Game Law<page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> to recover damages for the removal of trees from an unrelated parcel  of land located between the flow line of Stillwater Reservoir  and a boundary line described by the right-angle survey. The trees had been removed by the former owner of the parcel  after the State acquired the parcel.  The former owner argued that the land on which the trees were cut was not within the forest preserve  and, thus, the action under the Forest,  Fish and Game Law could not be sustained.</p><p>In Fisher, the Court held that lands appropriated by the Superintendent of Public Works pursuant to the Canal Law vested in the People of the State and were forest preserve  lands subject to the control of the Forest,  Fish and Game Commission (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="190 N.Y. 468,at 481"><content><span normalizedCite="190 N.Y. 468">id. at 481).<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#36#3#000190#000468#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> "The lands upon which the trees were cut are wild forest  lands owned by the state within the forest preserve,  and although acquired pursuant to the statutes relating to the canals and works belonging to the state connected with the canals, were acquired for purposes and objects directly connected with the forest preserve  and the preservation and supply of water in the streams leading from the forest preserve.  . . . The lands in question <page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> are not only owned by the state, but their retention as wild forest  lands is within the spirit as well as the letter of the statute creating and defining the preserve. The control of such forest  lands should be and is with the forest,  fish and game commission and the action was, therefore, properly brought pursuant to the Forest,  Fish and Game Law" (<citation type="case" normalizedCite="190 N.Y. 468,at 480"><content><span normalizedCite="190 N.Y. 468">id. at 480-481).<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#36#3#000190#000468#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> Thus, the Court expressly recognized that the State lands purchased by the Superintendent of Public Works pursuant to the right-angle survey for the development of the Stillwater Reservoir  were forest preserve  lands subject to the jurisdiction of the Forest,  Fish and Game Commission.</p><p>Beginning in 1911, the Legislature undertook major reforms of the State's conservation laws and agencies. In chapter 647 of the Laws of 1911, the Conservation Law was enacted (see L 1911, ch 647, § 1), and a Conservation Department in charge of a Conservation Commission comprised of three commissioners was created (see id. § 2). The Conservation Commission was given all the powers of, among other entities, the Forest,  Fish and Game Commission and the Commissioners of Water Power on Black River  (see id.). Jurisdiction<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> over and responsibility for the care and custody of the forest preserve  and the Adirondack Park, together with permitting authority over uses of the forest preserve,  was continued through the creation of a reorganized Conservation Department in 1926 (see L 1926, ch 619) and the establishment of the Department of Environmental Conservation in 1970 (see L 1970, ch 140).</p><p>I agree with the ALJ that Department staff  established that the lands east of respondent's parcel  adjacent to and under the waters of the Stillwater Reservoir  are State forest preserve  lands under the jurisdiction of the Department (see Summary Report at 7-9).</p><p>In addition, although it is not charged in this case, the Department also has jurisdiction over the site  of the dock  under ECL article 15, title 5 (Protection of Waters). The Stillwater Reservoir  is a navigable water of the State to which the public has access for boating, fishing, swimming, and other recreational uses (see Matter of Serth, Decision of the Commissioner, Dec. 19, 2012, at 7-8). Thus, any excavation, filling, or other modifications within the Stillwater Reservoir  associated with the placement of a dock  requires a permit from the Department pursuant<page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> to ECL 15-0505 (see also Navigation Law § 31). This requirement applies regardless of whether the lands underlying the waters of Stillwater Reservoir  are public lands, or private lands (see Navigation Law §§ 37, 31), which they are not in the location of respondent's dock.  Thus, the installation of a dock  below the mean high water  level of the Stillwater Reservoir  would require an ECL article 15 permit from the Department as well.</p><p>In sum, at all times relevant to this proceeding, the State lands to the east of respondent's parcel  have been forest preserve  lands within the Adirondack Park subject to the jurisdiction of the Department. Thus, respondent's construction and maintenance of the steps across State land without approval from the Department constitutes a violation of ECL 9-0303(2). Respondent's attachment of a dock  to State lands by means of stakes and a ramp  also constitutes a violation of ECL 9-0303(2). Respondent's cutting of vegetation  on the State land to the east of his parcel  constitutes a violation of ECL 9-0303(1). And finally, by maintaining a floating dock  and ramp  over submerged State lands and attaching the dock  to those State lands, thereby restricting the free <page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> use  of those lands by all the people of the State, respondent also violated ECL 9-0301(1) (see Matter of Bartell, Order of the Commissioner, Oct. 14, 2010, at 3). Accordingly, Department staff  has established the violations alleged in the motion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">III. Defenses</emphasis></p><p>For the reasons stated by the ALJ, I also reject the defenses raised by respondent (see, e.g., riparian rights  [Summary Report, at 9-12], Kimball Road [Summary Report at 12-16], and claims of estoppel and double jeopardy [Summary Report, at 16-17]).</p><p>I agree with the ALJ and conclude that respondent failed to establish that he is a riparian property owner with the right to wharf out to the navigable waters of the Stillwater Reservoir  at the location of the steps and dock  at issue (see Summary Report at 9-12). While a question of fact may exist concerning whether respondent's property abuts the mean high water  level of the Reservoir  at the northeast corner  of his parcel,  respondent's property does not abut the mean high water  level at the location of the steps and dock.  I agree that respondent has no right to trespass upon the State lands to the east of his property to access the Reservoir  (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="76 A.D.3d 705,at 707"><content>Kearns v Thilberg, <span normalizedCite="76 A.D.3d 705">76 AD3d 705<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000076#000705#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="76 A.D.3d 705">707<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000076#000705#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation><page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> [2d Dept 2010]).</p><p>As noted above, respondent also asserts that he has approval from the Hudson River-Black River  Regulating District (HRBRRD) for the steps and dock.  However, any approval respondent may have received from the District did not abrogate the need to obtain approvals from the Department. The Department has broad authority to regulate uses of forest preserve  lands and to protect the navigability of the State's waters. Accordingly, to the extent respondent had approval from HRBRRD to place a dock  below the mean high water  mark of the Stillwater Reservoir,  respondent still needed approval from the Department under both ECL article 9 and article 15. Indeed, HRBRRD's letter noted that authorization  from other State and federal agencies may be required prior to commencing the work referenced in the letter. I agree with the ALJ that respondent's letter from the HRBRRD does not provide a defense to the violations established (see Summary Report at 19-20).</p><p>For the reasons stated by the ALJ, I further agree that respondent's defense based upon a road respondent refers to as Kimball Road lacks merit. As to the remaining defenses raised by respondent, including estoppel and double<page number="17" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> jeopardy, I agree with the ALJ that they lack merit (see Summary Report at 16-17).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">IV. Penalty and Corrective Measures</emphasis></p><p>ECL 71-0703 supplies the appropriate penalty provision for the violations that staff  has charged in this proceeding, that is a civil penalty "of not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars" (see ECL 71-0703[1]; Summary Report, at 20-21). Based on my review of the record, I hereby adopt the ALJ's recommendation as to a civil penalty of four hundred dollars ($ 400).</p><p>Staff  requests, and the ALJ recommends, that I issue an order directing respondent to remove, and not replace, the floating dock  (which would include the ramp)  and stone  steps within thirty (30) days of the date of my order. The ALJ recommends that the penalty be suspended contingent upon respondent complying with the terms and conditions of this order, including the removal of these structures. I concur with the ALJ's recommendation.</p><p>However, if respondent fails to remove these structures, staff  requests that I direct staff  to remove them and seek reimbursement from respondent for the cost of removal. I concur with staff's  request. These corrective measures are appropriate and authorized<page number="18" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

ENV LEXIS 21"/> not relevant here] the lands owned or hereafter acquired by the state" within enumerated counties (forest preserve  counties). Stillwater Reservoir  is located in Herkimer County, which is among the designated forest preserve  counties (see id .). The reservoir  is operated by the Hudson River  - Black River  Regulating District (Regulating District) "for the purpose of regulating the flow of streams, when required by the public welfare, including public health and safety" (ECL 15-2103[1]). Although respondent does not contest that the reservoir  and the uplands along his parcel's  eastern boundary are owned by the State, he nevertheless argues that the State land at issue is not forest preserve  (see respondent filing, Dec. 31, 2011, at 3 [stating that "[w]e know the State of New York owns the land, but is it Forest Preserve  [land]?"]).</p><p>As respondent is aware, however, the Department has taken similar enforcement action against property owners along Stillwater Reservoir  to the south of the Kincade parcel  and the Commissioner has twice held such owners liable for the unauthorized use of forest preserve  land (see Matter of Bartell, Order of the Commissioner, Oct. 14, 2010; Matter of Wilson, <page number="36" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> Order of the Commissioner, Dec. 18, 2008; see also letter from this office to the parties, Nov. 2, 2010 [directing the parties' attention to the Commissioner's orders in Bartell and Wilson ]). Moreover, as noted in a ruling in Bartell, the Court of Appeals held in 1908 that the land acquired for Stillwater Reservoir  is part of the forest preserve  (Bartell, ALJ Ruling, June 11, 2009, at 4-5 n 5 [citing <citation type="case" normalizedCite="190 N.Y. 468"><content>People v Fisher (<span normalizedCite="190 N.Y. 468">190 NY 468<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#36#3#000190#000468#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>)],</content></citation> adopted by Order of the Commissioner, Oct. 14, 2010, at 2).</p><p>Despite the foregoing, respondent argues that the State lands at issue are not forest preserve  lands (response at 7). The easterly boundary of what is now the Kincade parcel  was established by the right angle  survey in 1898 when the State acquired land to raise the level of Stillwater reservoir  "for the use of the Canals" (staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 3 at 1 <footnote><anchor id="fnote13_123_1713_83"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p> The quoted text is from the original certification on an 1898 map  that depicts  the relevant portion of the right angle  survey. Exhibit 3 contains a second certification, dated April 29, 2008, by the Herkimer County Clerk certifying that the exhibit is a "correct transcript" of the original.</p></bodyText></footnote>]). As noted in Fisher, the right angle  survey "was done as described by the surveyor as follows, viz.: 'We would go just as far as we could this way, until we saw that we were going to run into the flow [i.e., the area that was to be flooded] and then we would turn and go the other way and<page number="37" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> turn a right angle.  In that way we went around the whole flow ground.' This survey included within straight lines the bays, arms and flowline of the reservoir"  (Fisher at 472). Respondent argues that lands acquired for canal purposes are not forest preserve  lands and asserts that the New York State Attorney General has issued opinions to that effect (response at 7).</p><p>Although respondent did not cite to a specific opinion of the Attorney General, there are opinions of the Attorney General that support respondent's contention that canal lands are not forest preserve  lands. Of particular note is a 1918 opinion (1918 opinion) that discusses this issue in some detail. The 1918 opinion concerns lands acquired by the State for two reservoirs,  the Hinckley reservoir  and Delta reservoir.  The lands at issue were located within forest preserve  counties and were acquired "for the improvement of the<page number="38" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> Erie canal" (1918 Ops Atty Gen 191, 192). The 1918 opinion states that "the lands at the Hinckley and Delta reservoirs  including the lands between the flow line and boundary of the area appropriated are not part of the Forest Preserve"  (id . at 206). The Hinckley and Delta reservoirs,  like Stillwater Reservoir,  were acquired for canal purposes (Hinckley and Delta for purposes of the Erie Canal and Stillwater for purposes of the Black River  Canal) and are located in forest preserve  counties (id . at 192).</p><p>In the 1918 opinion, the Attorney General placed substantial weight on the fact that State-owned canal lands, like forest preserve  lands, enjoyed constitutional protection. The 1918 opinion cites former New York Constitution article VII, § 8, which expressly provided that certain State-owned canals "shall remain property of the state and under its management forever" (1918 Ops Atty Gen 191, 195). Therefore, the Attorney General opined, "the Constitution makers gave equal dignity and force to the work of the canals and the Forest Preserve"  (id . at 196). The Attorney General further opined, however, that "[i]f such lands should later become part of the Forest Preserve,  it would be<page number="39" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> because of some other compelling reason, possibly such as the abandonment of the lands for canal purposes" (id . at 197). That is precisely what has happened with the former canal lands that are at issue in this proceeding.</p><p>The lands acquired by the State within the right angle  survey were acquired to enlarge Stillwater Reservoir  for use of the Black River  Canal, and that canal was abandoned in the 1920s (see <url normalizedValue="http://www.blackrivercanalmuseum.com/CanalHistory.htm">http://www.blackrivercanalmuseum.com/CanalHistory.htm</url> [accessed Jan. 31, 2013] [stating that the BlackRiver  Canal was "abandoned by the state in 1922"]; see also <citation type="case" normalizedCite="203 A.D. 43,at 44"><content>Board of Black River Regulating Dist. v Ogsbury, <span normalizedCite="203 A.D. 43">203 AD 43<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#237#3#000203#000043#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="203 A.D. 43">44<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#237#3#000203#000043#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [4th Dept 1922] [discussing the then pending acquisition of additional lands to enlarge Stillwater Reservoir,  not for canal purposes, but for regulating "the flow of the Black river  and its tributaries so that disastrous and destructive floods may be prevented and a somewhat constant flow of water may be secured in the streams in dry seasons"]). Notably, the constitutional provision cited by the Attorney General has been amended and no longer includes the Black River  Canal among the canals that are protected (see NY Const, art<page number="40" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> XV, § 1 [listing only "the Erie canal, the Oswego canal, the Champlain canal, and the Cayuga and Seneca canals"]).

In its last filing on the instant motion, staff  acknowledges that respondent's survey indicates that "the <emphasis typeStyle="bf">corner</emphasis> of his property touches the high flow line for the Stillwater reservoir"  and states that, as a littoral owner, respondent "is within his rights to erect and maintain a dock  extending from his property . . . at [the] location where<page number="44" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

At most, respondent claims ownership of a few feet  along the mean high water  line of Stillwater Reservoir  at the northwest corner of his parcel  (see respondent filing, Dec. 31, 2011, attachment [respondent's survey]). Respondent's survey identifies the mean high water  mark line as the "edge of vegetation"  and depicts  no more than three feet  of the high water  line running across the corner of the Kincade parcel  (id .).</p><p>Department staff  does not concede, and I do not hold, that the edge of vegetation  as depicted on respondent's survey is the shoreline  of Stillwater Reservoir  for the purposes of establishing whether the Kincade parcel  enjoys riparian rights.  Indeed, there is much in the record to call this into question. Staff  did extensive research to ascertain the average high water  mark of Stillwater Reservoir.  For the most recent period analyzed by staff,  the period from 1996 to 2004, staff  determined that the elevation  of the<page number="45" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> average high water  mark of the reservoir  was 1677.61 feet  (see staff  brief, exhibit L [Ashline affidavit at 4]). This is more than twenty inches below the 1679.39 elevation  noted on respondent's survey as the elevation  of the edge of vegetation  on the Kincade parcel.  Moreover, staff  filed a survey of the Kincade parcel,  together with an affidavit by the surveyor, that depicts  the lowest elevation  of the parcel  to be at 1679.6 feet  (staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit PP S-U, exhibit 20]).</p><p>Additionally, I note that ECL 15 2101(11) defines the "high flow line" of a reservoir  to mean "the line which will be made around a reservoir  by the water therein when it is at the level of the crest of the reservoir  spillway." Pursuant to ECL 15 2133(1), a regulating district "shall not permit the water in any reservoir  to rise above the high flow line thereof, except during floods or other emergencies." According to the Regulating District's website, the spillway crest at the Stillwater dam is at an elevation  of 1679.3 feet  (see <url normalizedValue="http://www.hrbrrd.com/bulletin_files/Stargetelevation.pdf">http://www.hrbrrd.com/bulletin_files/Stargetelevation.pdf</url> [accessed Jan. 25, 2013] [also showing that the "historic averageelevation"  of Stillwater Reservoir <page number="46" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The elevation  of the spillway crest was also used to describe the shoreline  boundary in a 1992 deed  that conveyed lands along Stillwater Reservoir  to the Regulating District (see response, exhibit 12 [deed  into the Regulating District describing "a point in the shoreline  of the Stillwater Reservoir  at elevation  1679.3" and setting a boundary line of the parcel  as running along the "shoreline  elevation  contour of 1679.3"]).</p><p>For the purposes of deciding the instant motion, I will assume, without deciding, that the edge of vegetation  as shown on respondent's survey is the shoreline  of Stillwater Reservoir  and that, therefore, the Kincade parcel  has riparian rights  to the reservoir.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote15_138_2250_115"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p> As discussed above, because the water body at issue is a reservoir,  the Kincade parcel  may lack riparian rights  irrespective of whether it touches the waters of Stillwater Reservoir. </p></bodyText></footnote> Even under these assumptions, however, respondent may be held liable for the violations alleged by Department staff.  This is because riparian rights  do not include the right to trespass upon uplands owned by another (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="76 A.D.3d 705,at 707"><content>Kearns v Thilburg, <span normalizedCite="76 A.D.3d 705">76 AD3d 705<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000076#000705#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="76 A.D.3d 705">707<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000076#000705#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2d Dept 2010] [holding that "[t]he riparian rights  of an uplands owner are limited, however, to the waters in front of that owner's property and do<page number="47" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

(citations omitted)]).</p><p>Respondent's own survey plainly depicts  that there is a wedge-shaped upland area along the eastern boundary of the Kincade parcel  that is owned by the State (see respondent filing, Dec. 31, 2011, attachment). As shown on respondent's survey, the stone  stairway erected by respondent crosses this State-owned upland. This upland area is also the area where staff  alleges respondent has undertaken vegetative management. Accordingly, respondent may not rely upon his assertion of riparian rights  as a defense against staff's  allegations concerning respondent's stairway and vegetative management on the State lands at issue.</p><p>With regard to the floating dock,  all of the photographic evidence depicting the location of the dock  relative to the shoreline  depicts  the dock  extending out generally in line with the <page number="48" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

As noted above, the lower portion of respondent's stairway is located entirely on State land. Accordingly, Department staff's  allegations regarding respondent's floating dock  do not concern the use of the foreshore and waters adjacent to the three feet  of shoreline  that respondent claims is on the northeast corner  of his parcel. </p><p>In addition to his argument that his parcel  enjoys riparian rights  because of its frontage on Stillwater Reservoir,  respondent argues that his parcel  retains riparian rights  to the reservoir  pursuant to the chain of title for his parcel.  Specifically, respondent proffers a 1901 deed  which conveyed certain lands of the Adirondack Timber and Mineral Company. Respondent asserts that the deed  reserved "the rights at all times, on the part of the said Grantor and his Assigns to a reasonable use of the shore  of the Reservoir"  and respondent argues that those rights extend to his parcel  (response at 7, exhibit 9). Staff <page number="49" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> responds that the 1901 deed  relates to land "located well to the north of Respondent's parcel  and is not connected in any way to his parcel  and the 1902 deed  that is in Respondent's chain of title" (staff  filing, Oct. 17, 2008, at 3).</p><p>The 1901 deed  does not appear in the deeds  identified by staff  as comprising "the chain of title to the Respondent's parcel  from 1898 forward" (staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit P L]; see also id . [Contino affidavit P F.1.ii [listing all deeds  in respondent's chain of title since 1898]). Moreover, the 1901 deed  states that the subject lands are being conveyed to Elon R. Brown and not, as respondent asserts, to "Titus Meigs" (response at 7, exhibit 9). The deed  into Titus Meigs and Ferris Meigs that is in the chain of title for the Kincade parcel  is the 1902 deed  identified by staff  and it does not contain a reservation of the right to use of the shore  of Stillwater Reservoir  (see staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit P F.1.ii, exhibit 4]). In any event, where a parcel  having riparian rights  is subdivided, only those parcels  that remain contiguous to the water body retain those rights, unless the deed  to a noncontiguous parcel  expressly<page number="50" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The 1918 deed  that subdivided what is now the Kincade parcel  from a larger tract does not contain a reservation of rights to use Stillwater Reservoir  (staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 7] [deed  by James and Lucy Dunbar conveying "Lot No. 2, of [the] Dunbar Cottage Lots"]).</p><p>I conclude that the riparian rights  enjoyed by the Kincade parcel,  if any, are the result of its having frontage on the mean high water  line of Stillwater Reservoir.  Because the area adjacent to where respondent claims frontage on Stillwater Reservoir  is not the area that is the subject of this proceeding, I further conclude that the issue of whether the Kincade parcel  has riparian rights  is immaterial to these proceedings.</p><p>Kimball Road<br/><page number="51" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/><br/>In addition to his assertion that the northeast corner  of his parcel  is below the mean high water  mark of Stillwater Reservoir,  respondent also asserts that this same northeast corner  touches a public road. Specifically, respondent asserts that there is "a public road that runs just in front [i.e., on the reservoir  side] of my property called the Kimball [R]oad" (response at 9). Based on this assertion, he argues that "any use of the land under the water in front [of] my land would have been on the public road that is neither the jurisdiction of the DEC nor [the Regulating District]" (id . at 11). This argument fails for several reasons.</p><p>First, assuming that all other issues relating to respondent's Kimball Road argument were resolved in respondent's favor, the assertion that the dock  is always floating above Kimball Road presents an impossibility. As the record plainly reflects, the water level of Stillwater Reservoir  fluctuates widely, sometimes exposing substantial portions of the foreshore near the Kincade parcel  (see e.g . staff  brief, exhibits C [Scanlon affidavit, photographs  1, 2, 12], E [Rivers  affidavit, photographs  2, 5], N [Damato affidavit, photograph  17) and sometimes<page number="52" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

These fluctuations in the location of the shoreline  necessitate corresponding changes in the location of respondent's dock.  Accordingly, at most, respondent's dock  floats above Kimball Road only on those occasions when the level of the reservoir  dictates that it must.</p><p>In addition, respondent fails to establish the location of Kimball Road in relation to the Kincade parcel  or, more particularly, in relation to where he floats his dock.  Respondent proffers a partial copy of an undated, unsigned map  (exhibit 12 map)  and asserts that it establishes that the northeast corner  of his parcel  touches the edge of Kimball Road (response at 11, exhibit 12 at 9 <footnote><anchor id="fnote17_147_2649_88"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p> The road depicted on the exhibit 12 map  is not named.

The exhibit 12 map,  however, depicts  the boundaries of the Kincade parcel  in a manner that is inconsistent with all of the other maps  in the record that depict  the boundaries of the parcel.  The exhibit 12 map depicts  three contiguous parcels  of equal size (the <page number="53" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> dimensions of the parcels  are not stated and no scale is provided) along the western boundary line of lands owned by the "State of New York" (id .). Respondent asserts that the northernmost of these three contiguous parcels  is now the Kincade parcel.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote16_147_2688_20"/><label>12</label><bodyText><p> The northernmost parcel  is marked, apparently by respondent, as "Kincade Now" (id.).</p></bodyText></footnote> The exhibit 12 map  also depicts  what appears to be the present-day high flow line of Stillwater Reservoir.  Respondent asserts that the map  demonstrates that the northeast corner  of his parcel  is both at the edge of Kimball Road and on "the lake side of the high water  mark" (response at 11).</p><p>No other map  filed by the parties<page number="54" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> depicts  the Kincade parcel  as one of three contiguous parcels  of the same size (see e.g . response, exhibits 4 at 1-3 [undated portions of three tax maps,  respondent states the second map  depicts  a correction done by the Town of Webb in 1999 (response at 3)], 5 at 1 [undated map] , 14 at 2 [1993 Kovach survey]; respondent filing, Dec. 31, 2011, attachment [respondent's survey]; staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibits 1 (2006 Department survey), 15 (1971 DEC survey), 17 (1927 Dunbar subdivision map) , 18 (1924 map  of lands to be flowed), 20 (2007 DEC spot elevations  map) ]). Where sufficient information on the relevant boundary lines is provided, the parcels  along the western boundary of the State lands near the Kincade parcel  are depicted as a mix of 100-foot wide lots and 50 foot wide lots, with the Kincade parcel  shown as a 50 foot-wide lot sandwiched between two 100-foot wide lots. This is also consistent with the deeds  in the chain of title for the Kincade parcel  which describe the parcel's  eastern boundary line along the State land as being 50 feet  wide (see e.g . staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibits 7 at 1 (1918 deed  conveying "Lot No. 2, of [the] Dunbar<page number="55" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Accordingly, the exhibit 12 map  is not probative of the location of the northeast corner  of the Kincade parcel  in relation to Kimball Road or the high flow line of Stillwater Reservoir. </p><p>Among the maps  filed by Department staff  is a map  (takings map)  of "Lands to be Taken, Flowed or Damaged" that was created in May 1923 by the former Black RiverRegulating District when it was in the process of acquiring lands that were to be flooded when the height of Stillwater Dam was raised (staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 18]). The takings map  bears a certification by the Department<page number="56" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> that it is a "true and complete" copy of the original map  which is maintained by the Department. Like respondent's exhibit 12 map,  the takings map  depicts  the present-day high flow line of the reservoir  (id . [depicting the "High Flow Line" of the "Area to be Flowed" by raising the Stillwater Dam]). The takings map  depicts  the Kincade parcel  as being 50 feet  wide, sandwiched between two 100-foot wide parcels,  with the high flow line passing to the north of the northeast corner  of the Kincade parcel.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote19_153_2932_17"/><label>14</label><bodyText><p> This is also consistent with the 1924 deed  under which the State acquired that portion of the parcel  (north parcel)  to the north of the Kincade parcel  that was to be flooded by the raising of the dam. The 1924 deed  describes the portion of the north parcel  that is to be flooded and states that the eastern boundary, measured south from the northeast corner  of the north parcel,  will be "about 94 feet"  (see staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 14 at 1]). The eastern boundary of the north parcel  is 100 feet  long (see id. exhibits 17, 18, 20; response, exhibit 14). Accordingly, the 1924 deed  indicates that the flowed land intersects the eastern boundary of the north parcel  approximately six feet  north of the northeast corner  of the Kincade parcel. </p></bodyText></footnote> The takings map  depicts  Kimball Road (as an unnamed road) crossing the State land boundary line, not at the Kincade parcel,  but near the northeast corner  of the 100-foot wide parcel  to the immediate north of the Kincade parcel  (id .).</p><p><page number="57" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The lot that is today the Kincade parcel  did not exist at the time that the right angle  survey was created, however, the right angle  survey map  shows the section of the State land boundary where the Kincade parcel  is now located. Specifically, the Kincade parcel  is located along the section of the right angle  survey line (north-south line) that runs north-south, just north of the Carthage and Lake Champlain Road (see staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 3 (the north-south line is depicted near the center of the map) ]). Using the southernmost point of the north-south line as the starting point, the map  shows Kimball Road crossing the north-south line approximately 750 feet  to the north. Using the same starting point on the 2006 Department survey (staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 1]) the northeast corner  of the Kincade parcel  is depicted as less than 650 feet  to the north on the north-south line. Accordingly, these maps,  like the takings map,  indicate that the northern boundary line of the Kincade Parcel  intersects the State land boundary line approximately 100 feet  south of<page number="58" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Kimball Road is the only<page number="62" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> road that is depicted in the vicinity of the dam site  and may have been nothing more than an access road.

A 1927 map  of the area, signed by a licensed professional engineer and land surveyor, does not depict  Kimball Road at all, but does depict  the southern portion of a "Road to Dam" at the location of Necessary Dam Road (see staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 17]).</p><p>Additionally, as depicted on the right angle  survey map,  Kimball Road was located entirely on lands then owned by the Adirondack Timber &amp; Mineral Company (ATMC), and was partially within and partially without the boundaries of the right angle  survey (staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 3]). The two sections<page number="63" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> of Kimball Road that were outside the right angle  survey boundary were appropriated from ATMC by the State as discrete parcels  (see id . [Contino affidavit, exhibit 2 at 2 (note that the two sections of Kimball Road are described under the heading "Description of Road to be Condemned on the Land of the Adirondack Timber &amp; Mineral Company" and the "beginning" points in the deed  descriptions for the parcels  are denoted on the right angle  survey map) ]). If Kimball Road had been a public highway, the State would not have needed to appropriate the land from ATMC in order to use the road.</p><p>From all of the foregoing, I conclude that respondent's arguments concerning Kimball Road are without merit and unsupported by evidence. Accordingly, respondent may not rely upon use of Kimball Road as a defense against staff's  allegation that respondent maintained his floating dock  over State land without authorization  from the Department.</p><p>Other Issues Raised by Respondent</p><p>--Estoppel</p><p>Respondent argues that "DEC has recognized that the up land owners have been utilizing the state land in front of them for reasonable use of recreation for the past ninety years" and questions the legality of the Department's<page number="64" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> current enforcement effort (response at 2). Essentially, respondent's argument is one of estoppel. Regardless of whether respondent is able to establish the elements of estoppel, the defense of estoppel is unavailable to respondent in the context of this proceeding. It is well settled that a governmental unit may not be estopped from the proper discharge of its statutory duties (see e.g . <citation type="case" normalizedCite="10 N.Y.3d 776,at 779"><content>Matter of Schorr v New York City Dept. of Housing Preserv. and Dev., <span normalizedCite="10 N.Y.3d 776">10 NY3d 776<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34042#3#000010#000776#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="10 N.Y.3d 776">779<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34042#3#000010#000776#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>,</content></citation> [2008] [stating that "It is well settled that estoppel cannot be invoked against a governmental agency to prevent it from discharging its statutory duties" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)]; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="71 N.Y.2d 274,at 282"><content>Matter of Parkview Assoc. v City of New York, <span normalizedCite="71 N.Y.2d 274">71 NY2d 274<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000071#000274#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="71 N.Y.2d 274">282<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000071#000274#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1988] [holding that "estoppel is not available to preclude a municipality from enforcing the provisions of its zoning laws and the mistaken or erroneous issuance of a permit does not estop a municipality from correcting errors, even where there are harsh results"] [citations omitted]). Here, the Department has a clear statutory duty to protect forest preserve  land and the Department's prior acquiescence<page number="65" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> toward respondent's activities cannot serve to foreclose the Department from fulfilling that duty.</p><p>--Double Jeopardy</p><p>Respondent states that he was issued a ticket in December 2003 for replacing the stairs from his parcel  to the reservoir.  He further states that he was scheduled to attend a hearing on the ticket sometime in early 2004, but that he had to cancel because of health reasons. He asserts that he was later advised by the Department that if he "didn't [hear] from anybody by [December 31,] 2004 that the ticket would be thrown out" (response at 6). Respondent argues that, since he was not subsequently contacted about the ticket, the matter was resolved and he asks, "is the DEC allowed to play double jeopardy?" (id .).</p><p>This argument is without merit. The 2003 ticket issued to respondent was not adjudicated nor was it formally resolved through an order on consent or other means. Moreover, the charge set forth under the 2003 ticket alleges that respondent excavated the bank of the reservoir  below the mean high water  line in violation of ECL 15-0505(1) (see response, exhibit 7). That alleged violation is not charged as part of the instant proceeding. Accordingly, it cannot be<page number="66" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> said that respondent has twice been put in jeopardy for the same offense (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="19 N.Y.3d 390,at 394"><content>People v Gause, <span normalizedCite="19 N.Y.3d 390">19 NY3d 390<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34042#3#000019#000390#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="19 N.Y.3d 390">394<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34042#3#000019#000390#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2012] [holding that "[a]t its core, double jeopardy precludes the government from prosecuting a defendant for the same offense after an acquittal or a conviction; or from imposing multiple punishments for the same offense in successive proceedings" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)]).</p><p>First Cause of Action </p><p>By its first cause of action, Department staff  alleges that at various times between May 25, 2001 and August 24, 2007, respondent cut, removed, injured or destroyed trees or other property on State land without authorization,  in violation of ECL 9-0303(1). Respondent denies the allegation (response at 15).</p><p>Respondent does not deny that the vegetation  on the eastern portion of the Kincade parcel  is similar in appearance to the vegetation  on the adjoining State land east of his parcel.  Respondent also acknowledges that "the pattern of vegetation"  in the subject area "has not changed in forty plus years" (response at 15-16 [referring to exhibit 17 at 2]). The vegetation  in much of this area, on both sides of the State land boundary, <page number="67" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> has a lawn-like appearance, with little variety in plant species, and is generally uniform in height (see e.g . response, exhibit 17 at 2-6; staff  brief exhibits C [Scanlon affidavit PP E.2-E.4, photographs  2, 3, 6, 12], D [Keating affidavit P 3, photograph  2], E [Rivers  affidavit PP 4.A, 4.C-4.D, photographs  1, 3-4], N [Damato affidavit, photograph  19]). Respondent denies that he has actively managed the vegetation  on the State-owned portion of this area and argues that the lawn-like appearance is the result of foraging by wildlife (response at 16, exhibit 17 [photographs  at 4-6]). He states that he has observed ducks, squirrels, chipmunks, geese and ravens foraging on the site  (id .).</p><p>Department staff  filed the affidavit of a DEC forester with extensive forestry experience in support of this cause of action  (see staff  brief, exhibit E [Rivers  affidavit PP 1-3]). The forester attests that the conditions he observed on the site  "clearly demonstrate prolonged vegetative maintenance . . . The most compelling indicator of maintenance is a low density of mature trees and lack of tree seedlings and/or saplings" (id . [Rivers  affidavit P 4.A]). Attached to the forester's affidavit are<page number="68" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> a series of photographs  that portray the differences between areas where vegetation  has been actively managed and areas where the vegetation  has generally been left in its natural state. Of particular note are the forester's comparisons between photographs  of the State land at issue and adjacent or nearby State lands where the vegetation  has not been actively managed (id . [Rivers  affidavit P 4, photographs  1 through 8]). As staff's  proffer demonstrates, the routine management of vegetation  at the site  results in the destruction of young trees and other plants and prevents them from reaching maturity (id .). Staff's  proffer establishes that vegetation  at the site  was actively managed at various times from 1998 through August 30, 2007 (see findings of fact P 4).</p><p>I conclude that Department staff  has met its burden to establish that respondent violated ECL 9-0303(1) by cutting, removing, injuring, or destroying trees or other property on the site  without authorization  during the time period alleged in the complaint. Staff  has filed sufficient evidence in admissible form to establish a prima facie case as to this cause of action.  In response, respondent has offered conjecture. Respondent's<page number="69" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> speculation that the foraging of wild animals may have resulted in the lawn-like appearance of the site  is not sufficient to defeat staff's  proffer and does not raise an issue of fact that warrants adjudication (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="49 N.Y.2d 557,at 562"><content>Zuckerman v City of New York, <span normalizedCite="49 N.Y.2d 557">49 NY2d 557<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000049#000557#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="49 N.Y.2d 557">562<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000049#000557#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>,</content></citation> supra ; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="86 A.D.3d 452,at 455"><content>Siegel v City of New York, <span normalizedCite="86 A.D.3d 452">86 AD3d 452<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000086#000452#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="86 A.D.3d 452">455<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000086#000452#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1st Dept 2011] [holding that an "unsupported assertion . . . is mere conjecture and fails to raise a triable issue of fact"]).</p><p>Second Cause of Action </p><p>By its second cause of action,  Department staff  alleges that between at least June 30, 2003 and August 30, 2007, respondent maintained an unauthorized floating dock  on, over, and attached to State land in violation of ECL 9-0303(2). Respondent denies that he maintains a dock  on the reservoir  and argues that the alleged dock  is actually a pontoon boat (response at 8).</p><p>For the purposes of determining the instant motion, I accept as true respondent's assertion that the floating dock  is a pontoon boat. This, however, is a distinction without a difference in the context of this proceeding. Respondent is clearly using the subject pontoon boat as a floating dock;  it is fixed<page number="70" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> to the underwater lands of the State by steel rods or pipes, it has an access ramp  attached to it that extends onto the shore,  and respondent moors other watercraft to it (see staff  brief exhibits C [Scanlon affidavit PP E.1-E.3, photographs  1 (and accompanying text at 4), 8 (and accompanying text at 8), 12 (and accompanying text at 8)], D [Keating affidavit P 3, photograph  1], E [Rivers  affidavit P 4.E, photograph  5]). Moreover, although he denies that the subject pontoon boat is a floating dock,  respondent admits that he owns both it and the watercraft that are typically moored to it (see findings of fact P 6; see also staff  brief, exhibit F [respondent letter, Dec. 17, 2007, at 2 (stating that a DEC employee was "trespassing on my dock  without permission" )]).</p><p>I conclude that Department staff  met its burden to establish that respondent violated ECL 9-0303(2) by maintaining an unauthorized floating dock  on, over, and attached to State land. Specifically, I conclude that respondent maintained the dock  on State land during the boating season each year between 2003 and 2007, inclusive (see findings of fact P 6).</p><p>Third Cause of Action </p><p>By its third cause of action,  Department staff <page number="71" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> alleges that between at least the fall of 2003 and July 30, 2008, respondent maintained stone  steps on State land extending from the Kincade parcel  to the shore  of Stillwater Reservoir  in violation of ECL 9 0303(2). Respondent admits that he built and maintains the stone  steps on the State land adjacent to his parcel,  but argues that he built the stairway under authorization  from the Regulating District (response at 5).</p><p>Department staff  acknowledges that respondent sought permission  to build the stairway from a State agency that respondent thought was authorized to grant such permission  (staff  filing, Oct. 17, 2008, at 2). Nevertheless, staff  argues that because the Department, and not the Regulating District, has jurisdiction over the site,  respondent violated ECL 9 0303(2) by constructing and maintaining the stairway. Staff  states that it took respondent's effort to obtain permission  for the stairs into account and, therefore, staff  is not seeking a penalty in relation to this cause of action  (id .).</p><p>Notably, the Regulating District's letter to respondent authorizing the placement of the stone  steps advises respondent that the authorization  pertains only to "land below elevation <page number="72" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> 1679.3 feet, " the elevation  of the crest of the Stillwater Dam spillway (response, exhibit 6 at 1). Accordingly, the portion of respondent's stairway that was built on State land above 1679.3 feet  was not authorized by the letter from the Regulating District (see respondent filing, Dec. 31, 2011, attachment [respondent's survey]; staff  brief, exhibit G [Contino affidavit, exhibit 20]). More importantly, although the Regulating District has authority over the operation of Stillwater Reservoir  "for the purpose of regulating the flow of streams, when required by the public welfare" (ECL 15-2103[1]), the Department has the authority and the duty to enforce the provisions of ECL article 9 within the forest preserve  (see ECL 9-0105). Finally, as discussed above, estoppel is not available against the state under the circumstances presented here (see supra at 16-17).</p><p>Department staff  has met its burden of proof to establish that respondent maintained stone  steps on State land without authorization  in violation of ECL 9-0303(2) from fall 2003 to July 30, 2008.</p><p>Fourth Cause of Action </p><p>By its fourth cause of action,  Department staff  alleges that between at least June 30, 2003 and August 30, <page number="73" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> 2007 respondent violated ECL 9-0301(1) by maintaining an unauthorized floating dock  on, over, and attached to State land, thereby restricting the free use  of such lands by all the people. Respondent denies the allegation (response at 8).</p><p>Because I have determined that respondent has maintained a floating dock  on State land in violation of ECL 9-0303(2) (see second cause of action) , respondent is liable as a matter of law for violation of ECL 9 0301(1) (see Matter of Bartell, Order of the Commissioner, Oct. 14, 2010, at 3 [holding that "as a matter of law, the mere presence of unpermitted structures on State lands, in violation of ECL 9-0303(2), restricts the free use  by other persons of State lands, here located in the Adirondack Park, in violation of ECL 9-0301(1)"]). Accordingly, I conclude that, during the boating season each year between 2003 and 2007, inclusive, respondent interfered with the free use  of State land by all the people (see findings of fact P 6).</p><p>Penalty</p><p>Department staff  argues that the maximum penalty authorized by statute for respondent's violations is $ 500 per violation, with an additional penalty of $ 500 for each day during which each violation continues, <page number="74" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> as set forth in ECL 71-4003 (staff  brief at 14 15). Section 71-4003 sets forth the general civil penalty for violations of the Environmental Conservation Law where no specific penalty is provided for elsewhere in the ECL. As staff  counsel acknowledges, civil penalties for violations relating to ECL article 9 are provided for under ECL 71-0703. Staff  counsel argues, however, that "ECL 71-0703.1 relates to the criminal sentencing of a defendant for violating ECL Article 9" and "does not apply to the determination of civil penalty for administrative enforcement purposes" (id . at 19).</p><p>Department staff's  arguments concerning the applicability of ECL 71-4003 were considered at length and rejected in a previous matter before this office involving similar facts and allegations (see Matter of Bartell, ALJ Ruling, June 11, 2009 at 18-21 [concluding that "staff's  claim that ECL 71-0703(1) does not apply to administrative enforcement matters is without merit"], adopted by Order of the Commissioner, Oct. 14, 2010, at 2-3). Accordingly, the ECL 71-0703 supplies the appropriate penalty provision for the violations charged by staff  in this proceeding.</p><p>In its brief, Department staff  states that, <page number="75" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> "should the Commissioner determine that ECL 71-0703.1 provides the proper civil penalty . . ., then staff  seek[s] a civil penalty of no less than $ 40 but no more than $ 400" (staff  brief at 15). Section 71 0703(1) provides that, with certain exceptions not relevant here, "any person who violates any provision of article 9 . . . shall be liable to a civil penalty of not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars." <footnote><anchor id="fnote21_190_3837_370"/><label>16</label><bodyText><p> Effective March 1, 2004, the penalty provisions of ECL 71-0703 were amended [2004 amendments]. The 2004 amendments do not affect the penalty analysis here because the penalty amount applicable to respondent's violations was not changed by the amendments.</p></bodyText></footnote> As noted below, the maximum authorized penalty available for respondent's violations is in excess of the $ 400 requested by staff. </p><p>Staff  established that respondent violated ECL 9-0303(1) at various times between May 25, 2001 and August 24, 2007, by cutting, removing, injuring, or destroying vegetation  on State land. For the purposes of this penalty calculation, I will assume that respondent committed this violation only once each year from 2001 through 2007, inclusive. <footnote><anchor id="fnote22_192_3850_204"/><label>17</label><bodyText><p> A forest  ranger with the Department states that he "inspected the shoreline  area [adjacent to the Kincade parcel]  at least twice weekly from April through November [each year from 1998 through 2006]" (staff  brief, exhibit C [Scanlon affidavit P C]). He further states that "[d]uring each visit . . . that snow was not covering the ground, I also observed [the effects of] vegetative management (ground cover mowing, brush clearing, etc.) . . . on the State [land at issue]" (id. [Scanlon affidavit P E.4]). The ranger also states that he observed the effects of "vegetative management" on the site  during an August 24, 2007 inspection (id. [Scanlon affidavit at 8 (describing photograph  6)]). Although it may be reasonably inferred from these statements that respondent routinely "managed" (i.e., cut or mowed) brush and ground cover during each growing season from 1998 through 2007, staff  does not specifically allege that respondent engaged in this activity on multiple occasions each year. Under these circumstances, calculating the penalty using one violation per year is appropriate (see Matter of Bartell, Order of the Commissioner, Oct. 14, 2010, at 2-3, adopting ALJ Summary Report at 3 n 4; Matter of Wilson, Order of the Commissioner, Dec. 18, 2008, at 2, adopting ALJ Summary Report at 9 n 8).</p></bodyText></footnote> Accordingly, I conclude that<page number="76" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

ENV LEXIS 21"/><br/>With regard to respondent's violations of ECL 9-0303(2), I note that this provision reads, in its entirety, "Structures. No building <footnote><anchor id="fnote23_194_3883_260"/><label>18</label><bodyText><p> The Commissioner expressly adopted a broad definition to the word "building" as used in this provision of the ECL (see Matter of Bartell, Order of the Commissioner, Oct. 14, 2010, at 2 3, adopting ALJ Ruling, June 11, 2009, at 17 [concluding that "to narrowly construe the term buildings as urged by respondent would be inconsistent with the Department's duty under ECL 9 0303 to protect article 9 lands.

Arguably, each use of his floating dock  or stairs by respondent could be considered as a separate violation. However, given the lack of argument or evidence on this record concerning respondent's usage of these structures, this penalty calculation focuses on respondent's erection and maintenance of the structures on State land.</p><p><page number="78" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> Staff  established that respondent violated ECL 9-0303(2) by maintaining a floating dock  on the State land at issue without authorization  each year from 2003 to 2007, inclusive. As admitted by respondent, the floating dock  was removed at the end of each boating season and returned at the beginning of the following boating season (see findings of fact P 6). I conclude the maximum penalty authorized for this violation is $ 500 (one violation for each year that staff  alleges that respondent placed and maintained his floating dock  on the State land at issue, with each violation having a maximum authorized penalty of $ 100 pursuant to ECL 71 0703[1]).</p><p>Staff  established that respondent violated ECL 9-0303(2) from the fall of 2003 through and including July 30, 2008 by maintaining stone  steps on the State land at issue without authorization.  Unlike respondent's dock,  the steps remain in place once erected; therefore, I count this as one violation. I conclude the maximum penalty authorized for this violation is $ 100 (one violation having a maximum authorized penalty of $ 100 pursuant to ECL 71 0703[1]).</p><p>Staff  established that respondent violated ECL 9-0301(1) by maintaining a floating <page number="79" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> dock  on the State land at issue, thereby restricting the free use  of such land by all the people, each year from 2003 to 2007, inclusive. I conclude that the maximum penalty available for these violations is $ 500 (one violation for each year that staff  alleges that respondent placed and maintained his floating dock  on the State land at issue, with each violation having a maximum authorized penalty of $ 100 pursuant to ECL 71 0703[1]).</p><p>As outlined above, the $ 400 penalty requested by Department staff  is well within the maximum penalty available under the statute. Staff  argues that a penalty is warranted in this matter because respondent has had the use and enjoyment of the State land at issue for many years, essentially using the land "as an extension of Respondent's parcel"  (staff  brief at 21). Staff  also argues that the forest preserve  lands are intended for the use and enjoyment of the general public, "not for the private enjoyment of any particular individual" and respondent's violations "did direct violence to the achievement of that public purpose" (id .). Additionally, staff  states that respondent "clearly was on notice" since at least 2003 that his use of the State land<page number="80" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> at issue was unauthorized and he took no corrective action (id . at 22).</p><p>Consistent with prior Commissioner orders on similar matters, I recommend that the Commissioner assess the $ 400 penalty requested by staff  and suspend the entire amount provided respondent complies with the corrective measures set forth below (see Bartell, Order of the Commissioner, Oct. 14, 2010, at 4; Matter of Wilson, Order of the Commissioner, Dec. 18, 2008, at 3).</p><p>Corrective Measures</p><p>Staff  requests that the Commissioner issue an order directing respondent to remove, and not replace, the floating dock  and stone  steps from State land within 30 days of the date of the Commissioner's order. Further, if respondent fails to remove these structures, staff  requests that the Commissioner direct staff  to remove them and seek reimbursement from respondent for the cost of removal.</p><p>These corrective measures are appropriate and authorized. Section 9-0105(1) of the ECL states that "[f]or the purpose of carrying out the provisions of [ECL article 9], the department shall have the power, duty and authority to . . . [e]xercise care, custody and control of the several preserves, parks and other state lands described<page number="81" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 21"/> in this article." Additionally, ECL 9-0303(6) authorizes the Department to "dispose of any improvements upon state lands under such conditions as it deems to be in the public interest." As set forth in this summary report, respondent's maintenance and use of the dock  and stairs on forest preserve  lands is in violation of ECL article 9. Accordingly, the Commissioner has the authority to order respondent to remove, or have staff  remove, these unauthorized improvements from the forest preserve. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</emphasis></h><p>1.

Sherman, Administrative Law Judge</p><p>RULING</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">PROCEEDINGS</emphasis></h><p>This ruling addresses a motion to dismiss  (motion) filed with the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services by the City of New York, Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) on November 12, 2014. Staff  of the Department of Environmental Conservation (Department) filed an undated reply  (staff  reply)  in opposition to the motion.</p><p>By amended complaint (complaint), dated May 8, 2012, Department staff  alleges that respondents violated numerous provisions of the laws and regulations  pertaining to tidal  wetlands  and the State Pollution Discharge Elimination System (SPDES). The vast majority of the nineteen causes of action  set forth in the complaint arise from the operation of a portable  toilet  business by respondents other than DCAS. The eighteenth cause of action,  however, alleges that all respondents, inclusive of DCAS, are liable for violating a Department-issued permit (complaint P 104). Accordingly, DCAS is charged under only one of the nineteen causes of action. </p><p>By its motion, DCAS asserts two bases for dismissal: (1) that the complaint fails to state  a cause of action  against DCAS, and (2) <page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 20"/> that the action is time-barred  pursuant to the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR). As discussed below, I conclude that the complaint fails to state  a cause of action  against DCAS. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss  is granted on the first basis asserted by DCAS and I do not reach the issue of whether the action is time-barred. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">DISCUSSION</emphasis></h><p>On a motion to dismiss  for failure to state a cause of action,  the facts alleged in the complaint are accepted as true and the complaint is given liberal construction. The analysis turns on whether the facts alleged in the complaint state a cognizable claim (see <citation type="case" normalizedCite="84 N.Y.2d 83,at 87"><content>Leon v Martinez, <span normalizedCite="84 N.Y.2d 83">84 NY2d 83<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000084#000083#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="84 N.Y.2d 83">87-88<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000084#000083#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [1994]; <citation type="case" normalizedCite="113 A.D.3d 587,at 588"><content>Endless Ocean, LLC v Twomey, Latham, Shea, Kelley, Dubin &amp; Quartararo, <span normalizedCite="113 A.D.3d 587">113 AD3d 587<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000113#000587#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="113 A.D.3d 587">588-589<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#34043#3#000113#000587#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2d Dept 2014]).</p><p>Here, Department staff  alleges a single cause of action  against DCAS. Specifically, the complaint states that "[b]y altering, or allowing the alteration  of, Site  2 through the placement of fill, addition of a fence and the continued storage of dozens of portable toilets  [DCAS has] violated special condition 10 of Permit No. 2-6308-00357/[0]0001 [permit]" (complaint P 104). <page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 20"/>Staff  identifies "Site  2" as Queens County Tax Block 15375, Lot 20 and describes it as a small (30' x 100') "vacant parcel  of land" (id . PP 27-28). The complaint alleges that DCAS "conveyed  title to Site  2 to respondent [Charles W.] Howard" in 2001 and that, sometime after that conveyance, "[r]espondents <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_14_197_118"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> Although the complaint does not differentiate between individual respondents with respect to this allegation, it is clear that Department staff  is not alleging that DCAS engaged in the alteration  of the site.  Indeed, there is no indication that DCAS was even aware of the alleged alterations  at Site  2 until the Department contacted DCAS about the matter. Accordingly, as reflected in the complaint, the charge against DCAS is that it violated special condition 10 by "allowing the alteration"  of Site  2 after it was conveyed  to respondent Charles W. Howard (see complaint PP 63-71, 104).</p></bodyText></footnote> altered the site  by placing fill, adding a fence and storing dozens of portable toilets  on Site  2" (id . PP 67-70).</p><p>As alleged in the complaint, special condition 10 of the permit required DCAS to "take all appropriate measures  to ensure that for [Site  2 and certain other properties that <page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 20"/> are not the subject of this allegation] site  alterations  and/or development were prohibited" (complaint P 64; see also motion, exhibit 1 [permit at 5]).</p><p>DCAS argues that it "fully complied with special condition 10 of the permit" by including a restrictive covenant  in the deed  under which it conveyed  Site  2 to respondent Charles W. Howard in December, 2001 (motion at 2-3). DCAS further argues that it cannot be held liable "for alleged violations that occurred entirely <emphasis typeStyle="it">after</emphasis> DCAS relinquished ownership  and control of the property" and that were "committed by a third party" (motion at 3). Lastly, DCAS argues that it cannot be compelled to enforce the restrictive covenant  because the enforcement of a covenant  is a "discretionary decision" (id .).</p><p>In response, Department staff  argues that DCAS is obligated  under the permit to prohibit alteration  or development of Site  2 and, as demonstrated by the allegations against the other respondents, the restrictive covenant  did not satisfy that obligation (staff  reply  at 5-6). Staff  also argues that, because DCAS elected to fulfill its obligations under special condition 10 by including a restrictive covenant  in the deed,  DCAS no longer <page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 20"/> has discretion with regard to whether it should pursue enforcement of the covenant  (id . at 6-7). Lastly, staff  argues that DCAS' "failure to live up to its obligations was not cured by the expiration  of the permit" in 2009 (id . at 7).</p><p>Special condition 10 is vague and does not specify what constitutes taking "appropriate measures"  to prohibit site  alterations  or development. <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_19_335_85"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> DCAS did not raise the issue of whether special condition 10 is unenforceable on vagueness grounds and I do not reach that question here. I note, however, that permit conditions are enforceable in the same manner as regulations  (see ECL 71-1929[1]) and should be written to clearly define a permittee's obligations (see Matter of Seneca Meadows, Decision of the Commissioner, May 24, 2013, at 4 [concurring with ALJ ruling on permit conditions], Hearing Report, Sept. 6, 2012, at 55 [holding that "in the absence of a definition of 'high winds,' [the proposed permit condition]  is too vague to enforce"]).</p></bodyText></footnote> Arguably, taking no action may be "appropriate" if, for example, alteration  and development of the site  were already prohibited by law or regulation.  DCAS, however, sought to comply with special condition 10 by including a restrictive covenant  in the deed  for the site.  Among other things, the covenant  provides that there is to be "[n]o alteration  on any vacant  tract of land . . . which includes land contour work, topographic modifications, removal of top soil, vegetation, excavating, filling, dumping, changes in existing drainage systems," and "[n]o construction of a new building or other structure on the lot being sold" (motion, exhibit 2 [deed  at 5]). The restrictive covenant  is clearly intended to satisfy the requirements of special condition 10.</p><p><page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 20"/><br/>Department staff  does not object to the text of the restrictive covenant.  Rather, staff  objects to the failure of DCAS to pursue enforcement of the covenant  or use some other means to prohibit site  alterations  (staff  reply  at 6-7).</p><p>Notably, the permit requires DCAS to place a "notice  covenant"  in the deeds  of all the parcels  (not just that for Site  2) that are subject to the permit (motion, exhibit 1, permit at 5 [special condition 8]). This notice  covenant  places future purchasers  on notice  that "[a]ll or part of [each parcel]  may be part of a tidal  wetland  or tidal  wetland  adjacent area . . . regulated under New York State law" (id . attachment A). Given that the Department included a permit condition  that requires the use of a covenant  to provide notice  of possible wetlands  to future purchasers,  it would not seem unreasonable for DCAS to conclude that the use of a covenant  would be an "appropriate measure"  to ensure that future site  alterations  are prohibited at Site  2.</p><p>Department staff  suggests that DCAS should have retained title to Site  2 in order to prohibit site  alterations  (staff  reply  at 6-7). While retaining ownership  of Site  2 would have left DCAS in control of the<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 20"/> site,  nothing in the permit precluded DCAS from selling Site  2. Indeed, as reflected in the permit under the "Description of Authorized Activity," the very purpose of DCAS seeking the permit was to obtain authorization to subdivide the land so that the City could then sell the individual parcels  (motion, exhibit 1, permit at 1 2).</p><p>Department staff  points out that permits issued by the Department sometimes include provisions for ongoing maintenance, monitoring  or reclamation of a site  (at 7). As an example, staff  states that wetlands  permits sometimes include planting and monitoring  requirements that extend beyond the expiration  of the permit (id .). Staff  does not, however, cite to an enforcement matter where the owner of a property that was subject to such a permit condition  was held liable for violations of the permit condition  that were caused entirely by the actions of a subsequent owner of the land.</p><p>Department staff  states that DCAS "allowed the parcel  to become part of a commercial facility without even trying to enforce the deed  restriction" (id . at 6). Although staff  acknowledges that enforcement of a restrictive covenant  is normally discretionary, staff  argues that <page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 20"/> "the discretion is no longer unlimited" where the covenant  is intended to satisfy a permit condition.  Staff  appears to be arguing that DCAS is obligated,  in perpetuity, to commence litigation if the restrictive covenant  is ever breached. I can find no support for this position in Department precedent.</p><p>Under the circumstances presented here, I decline to hold that the Department may require that DCAS undertake litigation to comply with special condition 10. There is no allegation that any site  alteration  or development had occurred at Site  2 at the time DCAS sold the subject parcel.  Nor does staff  allege that DCAS in any way aided or encouraged, or for that matter was even aware of, the alleged actions of the other respondents that form the bases of staff's  complaint. DCAS included a restrictive covenant  in the deed  out to respondent Charles W. Howard and I hold that the covenant  was an appropriate measure  to ensure that no alterations  or development would occur at Site  2.</p><p>Accepting, as I must, that all the allegations set forth in the compliant are true, I conclude that Department staff  has failed to state a cause of action  against DCAS.

Martens, Commissioner</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDER</emphasis></h><p>This administrative enforcement proceeding involves allegations of the staff  of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("Department") that respondent Anthony Lopatowski d/b/a Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. ("respondent") violated article 33 of the Environmental Conservation Law ("ECL") and parts 325 and 326 of title 6 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations  of the State of New York ("6 NYCRR") by:</p><p>(i) failing to have the requisite  pesticide  business insurance from February 12, 2000 to at least January 5, 2013, in violation of 6 NYCRR 325.23(g);</p><p>(ii) failing to have the requisite  pesticide  business registration  while applying pesticides  from February 29, 2000 to at least January 5, 2013, in violation of ECL 33-0907(1), ECL 33-1301(8-a), and 6 NYCRR 325.23(a);</p><p>(iii) failing to have the requisite  commercial pesticides  applicator  certification  while applying pesticides  at least thirty-one  (31) times during the years 2008 through 2012, in violation of ECL 33-1301(8);</p><p>(iv) failing to maintain daily use records for at least thirty-one  (31) commercial pesticides  applications during <page number="2" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> the years 2008 through 2012, in violation of ECL 33-1205(1) and 6 NYCRR 325.25(a);</p><p>(v) failing to submit annual  reports for the years 2008-2012 comprising five (5) violations of ECL 33-1205(1) and 6 NYCRR 325.25(b); and</p><p>(vi) possessing  two restricted-use pesticides  without the requisite  purchase permit and without being a certified applicator,  comprising two (2) violations of ECL 33-0903, ECL33-1301(7) and 6 NYCRR 326.7(a) (see Complaint PP 32-43).</p><p>On April 22, 2014, a hearing to address these alleged violations was convened before D. Scott Bassinson, Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") with the Department's Office of Hearings and Mediation Services. ALJ Bassinson prepared the attached hearing report, which I adopt as my decision in this matter, subject to my comments below.</p><p>Although personally served with the notice of hearing  and complaint on January 12, 2014, respondent failed  to file an answer to the complaint, and failed to attend the January 28, 2014 pre-hearing  conference. As a consequence of respondent's failure to answer or appear in this matter, the ALJ recommends  that I grant staff's  motion for a default judgment,  with two modifications.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Liability</emphasis></p><p>With respect<page number="3" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> to the first (operation of a pesticide  business without the requisite  insurance) and second (commercial application of pesticides  without a pesticide  business registration)  causes of action, the evidence reflects that respondent applied pesticides  illegally only during the period of April 2008 through January 5, 2013. I agree with the ALJ that it would not be proper to find violations of the insurance and business registration  requirements during years for which there is no evidence in the record that respondent actually applied pesticides.  I therefore adopt the ALJ's recommendation to hold that respondent violated the insurance and business registration  requirements only for the period 2008 through January 5, 2013, rather than for the period of February 2000 through January 5, 2013 as alleged in the complaint.</p><p>The ALJ also recalculated the number of violations relating to respondent's failure to register his pesticide  business. Staff  alleged in effect that each application of a pesticide  during a period for which there is no pesticide  business registration  is a separate violation of the registration requirement.  The ALJ, however, concluded that the most reasonable interpretation<page number="4" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> is to calculate the failure to register based upon how often a business is required to register, and not each time pesticides  were applied (see Hearing Report, at 8 and fn 6). I agree with the ALJ's analysis.</p><p>Based on the foregoing, the ALJ found that respondent committed a total of 76 violations (see Hearing Report, at 10-11).</p><p>I concur with the ALJ that, with these modifications, staff  is entitled to a default judgment  pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15, and that, at the hearing, Department staff  presented a prima facie case on the merits, and proved its case by a preponderance  of the evidence (see Hearing Report, at 7-10). Accordingly, staff  is entitled to a judgment based on the record evidence.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Penalty</emphasis></p><p>With respect to the civil penalty,  Department staff  sought an order imposing a civil penalty  pursuant to ECL 71-2907(1), which establishes a civil penalty  not to exceed five thousand dollars  ($ 5,000) for a first violation,  and not to exceed ten thousand dollars  ($ 10,000) for a subsequent offense. Department staff  also considered applicable agency guidance (see Hearing Report, at 10). The ALJ recommends  a reduction in Department staff's  requested civil penalty  to one hundred <page number="5" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> twenty-one  thousand dollars  ($ 121,000). I agree with the ALJ's revision to staff's  requested civil penalty  which took into consideration the reduction in the years of insurance violations and the reduction in the number of violations relating to the business registration requirement  as discussed above, among other factors (see also Hearing Report, at 10-13).</p><p>The civil penalty  recommended by the ALJ is authorized and appropriate. As the ALJ found, the evidence in this matter - including respondent's own written and signed statement admitting to many of the violations - demonstrates a long-standing disregard for complying with the relevant legal requirements. Respondent has held himself out as a licensed exterminator and has applied pesticides  over a number of years, at locations including at least two schools and several apartment  buildings - without acquiring insurance, registering the business, obtaining proper applicator  certifications,  maintaining daily use records or filing annual  reports. Respondent was also unlawfully in possession of two restricted use pesticides. </p><p>I also agree with the ALJ that staff's  request that I order respondent "to become and remain in compliance <page number="6" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> with the ECL and Title 6 of the NYCRR" is unnecessary. Respondent is already required to comply with the ECL and the applicable regulations  and further language to that effect is not needed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">NOW, THEREFORE</emphasis>, having considered this matter and being duly advised, it is <emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDERED</emphasis> that:</p><p>I. Pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15, Department staff's  motion for a default judgment  is hereby granted. By failing to answer, respondent Anthony Lopatowski d/b/a Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. waived his right to be heard at the hearing. Accordingly, the factual allegations in Department staff's  complaint are deemed to have been admitted by respondent.</p><p>II. Moreover, based upon a preponderance  of the evidence introduced at hearing, respondent Anthony Lopatowski d/b/a Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. is adjudged to have violated:</p><p>A. 6 NYCRR 325.23(g), five (5) times by operating a pesticides  application business during the period April 2008 through January 5, 2013 without having the requisite  pesticide  business insurance;</p><p>B.

ENV LEXIS 40"/> pesticide  business registration; </p><p>C. ECL 33-1301(8), thirty-one  (31) times by applying pesticides  on thirty-one  (31) occasions without possessing  the requisite  commercial pesticide  applicator  certification; </p><p>D. ECL 33-1205(1) and 6 NYCRR 325.25(a), thirty-one  (31) times by not maintaining pesticide  use records with respect to thirty-one  (31) pesticide  applications;</p><p>E. ECL 33-1205(1) and 6 NYCRR 325.25(b), five (5) times by failing to submit annual  reports to the Department during the years 2008 through 2012 during which he applied pesticides;  and</p><p>F. ECL 33-0903, ECL 33-1301(7) and 6 NYCRR 326.7(a), two (2) times, by:</p><p>1. possessing  restricted use pesticide  Delta Dust Insecticide in 2010 without a purchase permit and without being a certified applicator;  and</p><p>2. possessing  restricted use pesticide  Ditrac Tracking Powder in 2013 without a purchase permit and without being a certified applicator. </p><p>III. Respondent Anthony Lopatowski d/b/a Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. is hereby assessed a civil penalty  in the amount of one hundred twenty-one  thousand dollars  ($ 121,000), which is due and payable within thirty (30) days of the service of a copy of this order upon respondent. <page number="8" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

The Department maintains a database that identifies pesticide  businesses that are registered  with the Department, identifies applicators  associated with such businesses, and reflects whether such businesses carry insurance, any history of enforcement, and payment of fees (Testimony of Marcus Pitter; Staff  Ex. 9).</p><p>3. Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. was initially registered  with the Department as a pesticide  business on March 1, 1989 (Staff  Ex. 9).</p><p>4. Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc.'s registration  with the Department expired  in February 2000 and remained expired  as of April 17, 2014 (Testimony of Marcus Pitter; Staff  Ex. 9).</p><p>5. Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc.'s insurance expired  in 2000 and remained expired  as of April 17, 2014 (Testimony of Marcus Pitter; Staff  Ex. 9; Complaint Ex. A).</p><p>6. Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. has not submitted an annual  report since 2000 (Testimony of Marcus Pitter).</p><p>7. The Department maintains a database, known as the "CertAdmin Database," that certified commercial pesticide  applicators  and the organization or business with which such applicators  are associated, as well as the categories for which the applicators <page number="19" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

Respondent Anthony Lopatowski was a certified commercial pesticides  applicator,  initially registered  with the Department in 1987 (Staff  Exs. 8 and 9).</p><p>9. Respondent Anthony Lopatowski's certification  as a commercial pesticides  applicator  expired  in 2000, and has not been renewed since that time (Testimony of Marcus Pitter; Staff  Ex. 8).</p><p>10. On June 4, 2010, following a traffic stop of respondent Anthony Lopatowski by Environmental Conservation Investigators Sara Komonchak and Thomas Graham, respondent consented to a search of his vehicle (Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk; Complaint PP 4-5).</p><p>11. A search of respondent's vehicle by Environmental Conservation Officer ("ECO") Jennifer Okonuk on June 4, 2010 led to the discovery of the following items:</p><p>a. Business cards of Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. identifying respondent Anthony Lopatowski as a "C.C.P.A.," an acronym for Certified Commercial Pesticide  Applicator; </p><p>b. Personal Protective Equipment;</p><p>c. A spray canister;</p><p>d. Twenty-three invoices  from "Safeguard Exterminating Inc." to various individuals and companies ranging in date from April 19, 2008 to May<page number="20" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

A one-pound container labeled "Delta Dust Insecticide"</p><p>(Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk; Staff  Exs. 3, 4A, 4B, 4C).</p><p>12. Delta Dust Insecticide, EPA Registration  No. 432-772, is a restricted use pesticide  in New York State (Testimony of Marcus Pitter; see also <url normalizedValue="http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/materials_minerals_pdf/pestprod.pdf">http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/materials_minerals_pdf/pestprod.pdf</url>) </p><p>13. Subsequent to the June 4, 2010 encounter with respondent, ECO Okonuk contacted customers  of respondent, and obtained from the customers  additional invoices  from "Safeguard Exterminating Service" and copies of checks made payable to "Safeguard Exterminating," dated between January 2011 and November 2012 (Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk; Staff  Ex. 5).</p><p>14. The additional invoices  that ECO Okonuk obtained from respondent's customers  reflect the application of pesticides  twice a month at two buildings, and at different locations within each building. For example, Invoice  # 10183, dated January 27, 2011, reflects two $ 80 charges, one for January 8, 2011 and the other for January 20, 2011. The invoice  states that it relates to application of pesticides  as per an<page number="21" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> "Apt. List" as well as in public areas and trash rooms (see Staff  Ex. 5).</p><p>15. On January 5, 2013, ECO Okonuk and ECO Christopher Lattimer waited for respondent at 118-11 84th Avenue, Jamaica, NY, after ECO Okonuk learned that respondent would be applying pesticides  at the building that day (Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk; Complaint P 7).</p><p>16. On January 5, 2013, ECO Okonuk saw a "sign-up sheet" in the apartment  building, relating to apartment  dwellers who had signed up for application of pesticides  in their apartment  (Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk).</p><p>17. On January 5, 2013, respondent signed a Voluntary Consent to Search form consenting to a search of his vehicle by ECO Okonuk (Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk; Staff  Ex. 6).</p><p>18. ECO Okonuk's search of respondent's vehicle on January 5, 2013 led to the discovery of, among other things, the following items:</p><p>a.

An open box containing a bag of white powder</p><p>(see Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk; Staff  Exs. 7A, 7B, 7C).</p><p>19. On January 5, 2013, respondent prepared and signed a Voluntary Statement that included his statements<page number="22" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> that he came to 118-11 84th Avenue that day "to exterminate building as a license exterminator" and that he treated the building "monthly and talk to supt. [probably "superintendent"] (Complaint Ex. A). Respondent also wrote in his Voluntary Statement that he owns Safeguard Exterminating and had 10 customers,  but did not have any records, insurance or labels (id.).</p><p>20. Respondent also wrote in his Voluntary Statement that he "had Ditrac Powder restricted use - rodent control" (id.).</p><p>21. Respondent told ECO Okonuk that he was at the 118-11 84th Avenue location on January 5, 2013 to apply pesticides  (Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk).</p><p>22. ECO Okonuk sent for testing, by Peter Furdyna, an Environmental Chemist with the Department, some of the white powder from the box found in respondent's vehicle on January 5, 2013 (Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk).</p><p>23. Testing of the powder found in respondent's possession on January 5, 2013 revealed that the powder contained diphacinone, the active ingredient in Ditrac Tracking Powder, and the results were consistent with Ditrac Tracking Powder (Testimony of Marcus Pitter; Testimony of Jennifer Okonuk).</p><p>24. Ditrac Tracking Powder, EPA Registration <page number="23" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

While it is possible, if not probable, that respondent applied pesticides  during that entire 13 year period, the record lacks evidence that respondent actually applied pesticides  during the period between 2000 and 2007. I therefore recommend  that the Commissioner find these violations to have occurred only during the period 2008 through January 5, 2013 (see Staff  Exs. 3 and 5).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Staff  has alleged that respondent violated the<page number="25" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

This number corresponds to staff's  characterization of the number of invoices  obtained by ECO Okonuk from respondent and respondent's customers  (see Complaint PP 5-6 [identifying a total of 31 invoices] ). Staff  alleges in effect that each <emphasis typeStyle="it">application</emphasis> of a pesticide  during a period for which there is no pesticide  business registration  is a separate and distinct violation of the registration requirement.  The statute and regulations  are silent on how to calculate the number of violations of the registration requirement.  The most reasonable interpretation of the statute, however, is to calculate the failure to register based upon how often a business is required to register; that is, one continuing violation during each three year period, commencing on the date of the first application of pesticides  without having such registration.  Such interpretation is consistent with and further supported by staff's  allegations that (i) respondent violated the requirement to have pesticide  business insurance once each year it failed to have the requisite  insurance, and (ii) respondent violated the requirement to file annual <page number="26" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> reports once each year it failed to so file, rather than each time it applied pesticides  during these five year periods. <footnote><anchor id="fnote7_131_1596_48"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p> This interpretation is also consistent with the Department's Pesticide  Enforcement Policy (DEE-12, rev. March 26, 1993), which sets a minimum penalty amount for each violation of the business registration requirement,  and describes each violation as an "offense" rather than on a "per incident" basis (compare, e.g., Pesticide  Enforcement Policy minimum penalties for certain violations on a "per incident" basis, e.g. sale of a restricted use pesticide,  possession of a restricted use pesticide  by a person not certified, violation of seizure, stop use or quarantine order, failure to obtain aquatic permit).</p></bodyText></footnote> I therefore recommend  that the Commissioner hold that respondent violated the business registration  requirements twice during the five year period of 2008 through 2012: once upon the first application of pesticides  in April 2008, and a second time as of April 2011, three years after the first violation.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote8_131_1608_3"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p> The evidence established that respondent continued to apply pesticides  throughout the two periods (see, e.g., Finding of Fact Nos. 11[d], 13).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="27" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

Staff  alleges that respondent "fail[ed] to have the requisite  pesticide  business insurance from February 12, 2000 to at least January 5, 2013" (Complaint P 33). Department records reflect that Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. had insurance from March 1989 until February 2000 (see Staff  Ex. 9). Staff  witness Marcus Pitter testified that he checked the relevant Department records and determined that Safeguard had no insurance after it lapsed in 2000 (Testimony of Marcus Pitter). In January 2013, respondent admitted in his signed Voluntary Statement that he did not have insurance (see Complaint Ex. A). I therefore recommend  that the Commissioner hold that respondent violated 6 NYCRR 325.23(g) by not possessing  the requisite  insurance.</p><p>Although I agree with staff's  allegation that respondent violated the insurance requirement, I do not agree with staff's  calculation of the total number of violations of that requirement.

While it is possible, if not probable, that respondent has been conducting his business throughout the entire period of time since his business registration  and insurance lapsed in 2000, the evidence submitted at hearing relates only to respondent's application and possession of pesticides  during the period 2008 through January 5, 2013, a total of five years (see discussion above at 7-8, and n. 5).

Staff  witness Pitter also testified that an effort was made to determine whether respondent was working as an apprentice under the direct supervision of a certified applicator,  but no such evidence was found (Testimony of Marcus Pitter). Although certifications  are valid for three or five years, depending on the type of certifications  (see ECL 33-0905[3]), it is unlawful "to engage in application of pesticides"  without the certification  (ECL 33-1301[8]). I therefore recommend  that the Commissioner hold that: (i) each application of pesticides  without proper certification  is a separate violation; and (ii) respondent therefore violated ECL 33-1301(8) thirty-one  times by applying pesticides  on thirty-one  occasions without possessing  the requisite  commercial pesticide   applicator   certification. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Failure to Maintain Daily Use Records</emphasis></p><p>Commercial pesticide   applicators  are required to maintain pesticide  use records for each pesticide  application (see ECL 33-1205[1]; 6 NYCRR 325.25[a]).

As discussed below, I recommend  that the Commissioner impose a civil penalty  of one hundred twenty-one  thousand dollars  ($ 121,000).</p><p>A person who violates any provision of ECL article 33 or any regulation  thereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty  of up to five thousand dollars  ($ 5,000) for a first violation  and up to ten thousand dollars  ($ 10,000) for each subsequent offense (see ECL 71-2907[1]). The first step in a civil penalty <page number="33" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> analysis is to calculate the maximum  possible penalty under the statute (see DEE-1, at 4). Staff  argues that respondent has committed a total of 113 violations, but has only used the initial violation figure of $ 5,000 for all violations, to arrive at a total maximum  penalty of $ 565,000 (see Justification, at 1). Pursuant to the statute, however, the maximum  civil penalty  for 113 violations would be $ 1,125,000 ($ 5,000 for the first violation,  plus a total of $ 1,120,000 for the 112 additional violations).</p><p>As discussed above, I do not agree with staff's  calculation of the total number of violations. I recommend  that the Commissioner hold that respondent committed a total of 76 violations, rather than 113 as alleged by staff,  as follows:</p><p>2 violations of the business registration requirement </p><p>5 violations of the insurance requirement</p><p>31 violations of the applicator  certification  requirement</p><p>31 violations of the daily use records requirement</p><p>5 violations of the annual  reporting requirement</p><p>2 violations regarding possession of restricted use pesticides </p><p>Based on a total of 76 violations, the maximum  statutory civil penalty  under ECL 71-2907(1) would be $ 755,000 ($ 5,000<page number="34" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> for the first violation,  plus $ 750,000 [$ 10,000 each for the 75 additional violations]).</p><p>Following a determination of the maximum  possible penalty, the civil penalty  analysis includes consideration of "benefit" and "gravity" components under the Department's Civil Penalty  Policy. The benefit component "is an estimate of the economic benefit of delayed compliance, including the present value of avoided capital and operating costs and permanently avoided costs which would have been expended if compliance had occurred when required" (DEE-1, at 5). The benefit component "should also include any other economic benefits resulting from noncompliance" (id.). The gravity component analysis includes consideration of several factors, including: (i) potential harm and actual damage caused by the violation, and relative importance of the type of violation in the regulatory scheme; (ii) culpability; (iii) violator cooperation; (iv) history of noncompliance; (v) ability to pay; and (vi) "unique factors" providing staff  with discretion to adjust penalties higher or lower due to factors not identified in the policy (see DEE-1, at 7-11).</p><p>I agree with staff's  analysis of the benefit and gravity<page number="35" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> components in this matter. Respondent has derived economic benefit from noncompliance, including avoiding paying pesticide  business registration  fees, pesticide  applicator  exam fees and other fees (see Justification, at 2; see also Testimony of Marcus Pitter [discussing fees associated with pesticide  certification  categories]).</p><p>With respect to the gravity component, Staff  established by a preponderance  of the evidence that respondent has been operating in violation of statutory and regulatory requirements for at least five years, and illegally applied pesticides  on at least 31 occasions during that period of time. Respondent's actions, and his own admissions, unequivocally demonstrate a flagrant and total disregard for complying with the relevant legal requirements. The record reflects that respondent has not held a commercial pesticides  applicator  certification,  registered  his business, or obtained the required insurance, since 2000. Respondent has nevertheless readily admitted, as recently as January 2013, that he holds himself out as a "license[d] exterminator" and provides services to ten customers  on a monthly basis, but has no records or insurance (Complaint Ex. A; Finding<page number="36" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> of Fact No. 19). In addition, respondent has not filed annual  reports for at least five years. Respondent's violations include repeated application of pesticides  at two schools, and many apartment  buildings (see Finding of Fact 11[d]; see also Ex. 3, at ninth and tenth unnumbered pages [stating that "monthly service" was provided to "Metropolitan Preschool, Inc. Early Intervention Center" and "Metropolitan Preschools, Inc.Williamsburg N. Side Preschool"]). Finally, during this period of illegal operation, respondent improperly twice possessed restricted use pesticides,  Delta Dust Insecticide and Ditrac Tracking Powder (see Finding of Fact Nos. 9, 11, 12, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24; Complaint Ex. A).</p><p>Appendix I to the Department's Pesticide  Enforcement Policy (DEE-12, rev. March 26, 1993) contains a schedule of minimum penalties to guide staff  in establishing appropriate penalties for violations such as those at issue here. The policy states that the amounts in the schedule represent "first offense minimums" which "should be doubled to determine a minimum penalty level on second, or subsequent offenses" (DEE-12, App. I, § II). Although staff  cites this policy generally, staff  has not provided<page number="37" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> a discussion of the application of each penalty "minimum" for each violation in this case; rather staff  argues generally that penalties in this case should be higher than the minimum because staff  has had to proceed to hearing, and "[t]o account for inflation that has occurred over the past twenty years" since the policy was last revised in 1993 (Justification, at 1). I agree with staff  that respondent's actions are particularly egregious, and that penalties significantly higher than the minimum penalties set forth in DEE-12 are warranted.</p><p>With respect to the first cause of action, alleging a failure to have insurance, DEE-12 does not provide a minimum penalty to be assessed (see DEE-12, App. I, at § IV [Business, Applicator  and Use Offenses]). As discussed above at pages 8-9, I revised the number of violations of the insurance requirement from thirteen alleged by staff  to five. The maximum  statutory penalty  for these violations would be $ 45,000 ($ 5,000 for the first violation,  $ 40,000 for the additional four violations). Staff  has requested, and I recommend,  that the Commissioner impose a $ 2,500 civil penalty  for each of the violations of the insurance requirement, and I recommend <page number="38" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> a total civil penalty  of $ 12,500 for the five violations.</p><p>With respect to the second cause of action,  alleging a failure to obtain business registration,  I have revised the number of violations from thirty-one  alleged by staff  to two (see discussion above at pages 7-8). The maximum  statutory penalty  for two violations would be $ 15,000 ($ 5,000 for the first violation,  $ 10,000 for the additional violation). DEE-12 provides that, for a first "offense," the minimum penalty would be $ 1,000, with an additional $ 100 for each "additional offense or different product" (id.). In my view, the failure to register a pesticide  business is significant, and warrants a substantial penalty. Staff  has requested, and I recommend,  that the Commissioner impose a $ 2,500 civil penalty  for each of the two violations of the business registration requirement,  for a total civil penalty  of $ 5,000.</p><p>With respect to the third cause of action,  ECL 33-1301(8) provides in relevant part that it is unlawful "[f]or any person to <emphasis typeStyle="it">engage in application of pesticides </emphasis> without a pesticide  applicator  certificate registration"  (emphasis added). Staff  alleges that respondent applied pesticides  at least thirty-one <page number="39" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> times during the years 2008-2012 without having the requisite  pesticide  applicator  certification.  DEE-12 provides a minimum penalty of $ 2,000 for pesticide  "misuse, <emphasis typeStyle="it">including unlawful application</emphasis>," in cases in which it is unknown whether there has been exposure to such pesticides  (id.). DEE-12 also sets forth a minimum penalty for failure to obtain an applicator  certification  of "$ 1,000 per year or portion thereof, per person" (id.). Given the statutory prohibition of "application of pesticides"  without a certification,  I agree with staff's  allegation that each application of pesticides  by respondent without being certified is a separate violation, and have recommended that the Commissioner so hold. The maximum  statutory penalty  for thirty-one  violations would be $ 305,000 ($ 5,000 for the first violation,  $ 300,000 for the additional thirty violations). Staff  has requested, and I recommend,  that the Commissioner impose a $ 2,500 civil penalty  for each of the thirty-one  violations relating to the third cause of action,  for a total civil penalty  of $ 77,500.</p><p>With respect to the fourth cause of action,  ECL 33-1205(1) provides in relevant part that ["a]ll commercial applicators <page number="40" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> shall maintain pesticide  use records <emphasis typeStyle="it">for each pesticide  application</emphasis>...." (emphasis added) (see also 6 NYCRR 325.25[a]). Staff  alleges that respondent failed  to maintain daily use records for at least thirty-one  applications of pesticides  during the period of 2008 through 2012. The maximum  statutory penalty  for thirty-one  violations would be $ 305,000 ($ 5,000 for the first violation,  $ 300,000 for the additional thirty violations). DEE-12 sets forth a minimum penalty for recordkeeping  violations <footnote><anchor id="fnote10_166_2385_41"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p> The statute cited in this cause of action,  ECL 33-1205, is entitled "Recordkeeping  and reporting" (see also 6 NYCRR 325.25 [entitled "Records and reports"]).</p></bodyText></footnote> of $ 250 "per violation." Staff  has requested that the Commissioner impose a $ 1,500 civil penalty  for each of the thirty-one  recordkeeping  violations, without mentioning the minimum penalty for such violations as set forth in DEE-12, or explaining how staff  arrived at a per-violation penalty amount that is six times the DEE-12 minimum. Given the number and breadth of violations in this case, I recommend  the Commissioner impose a $ 500 civil penalty  for each of the thirty-one  recordkeeping  violations, for a total civil penalty  of $ 15,500.</p><p><page number="41" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/><br/>The fifth cause of action  alleges that respondent failed  to file annual  reports five times, in violation of ECL 33-1205(1) and 6 NYCRR 325.25(b). The maximum  statutory penalty  for five violations would be $ 45,000 ($ 5,000 for the first violation,  $ 40,000 for the additional four violations). DEE-12 sets forth a minimum civil penalty  of $ 1,000 "per report" for failure to file business annual  report. Staff  has requested that the Commissioner impose a $ 1,500 civil penalty  for each of the five violations, without mentioning the minimum penalty for such violations as set forth in DEE-12. Given that the annual  report requirement is contained in the "recordkeeping  and reporting" statute and regulation,  I recommend  that the Commissioner treat this as a recordkeeping  violation, and impose a $ 500 civil penalty  for each of the five annual  report violations, for a total civil penalty  of $ 2,500.</p><p>The sixth cause of action  alleges that respondent twice possessed restricted use pesticides  without having the requisite  purchase permit and without being a certified applicator,  in violation of ECL 33-1301(7), ECL 33-0903 and 6 NYCRR 326.7(a). The maximum  statutory penalty  for two violations would<page number="42" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> be $ 15,000 ($ 5,000 for the first violation,  $ 10,000 for the additional violation). DEE-12 sets forth a minimum civil penalty  of $ 1,000 "per incident" for such violations. Staff  has requested, and I recommend,  that the Commissioner impose a $ 4,000 civil penalty  for each of the two violations relating to illegal possession of restricted use pesticides,  for a total civil penalty  of $ 8,000.</p><p>This matter involves a respondent who clearly knows how to comply with the legal requirements for operating a pesticides  application business. At one time, his business was registered  and insured, and he was properly certified as an applicator.  Respondent allowed these legal authorizations to lapse. The record establishes that, for at least five years, respondent held himself out - falsely - as a certified applicator,  and has repeatedly applied pesticides  in several locations, potentially exposing schoolchildren, among others, to pesticides.  Moreover, he has twice been found to possess restricted use pesticides  without proper certification.  Respondent's 76 violations established in this record are egregious.</p><p>I recommend  that the Commissioner impose a civil penalty  of one hundred twenty-one <page number="43" pageScheme="2014 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 40"/> thousand dollars  ($ 121,000) for these violations. The requested civil penalty  is fully consistent with prior precedent. See, e.g., Matter of Island Landscape LCP, Corp., Order of Assistant Commissioner, February 8, 2007; Matter of JR Tree Spraying, Inc. and Paul Ingrassia, Order of the Commissioner, November 15, 1999.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Additional Requested Relief</emphasis></p><p>Department staff  has also requested that the Commissioner order respondent "to become and remain in compliance with the ECL and Title 6 of the NYCRR" (Complaint, at 6, Wherefore Clause P 3). This request is unnecessary. Respondent is already required to comply with ECL article 33 and the relevant regulations  if he intends to operate a pesticide  application business or work as a pesticide   applicator  (see, e.g., Matter of Island Landscape LCP, Corp., at 5). I therefore recommend  that the Commissioner hold that staff's  request in this regard is unnecessary.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Recommendations</emphasis></p><p>Based upon the foregoing, I recommend  that the Commissioner issue an order:</p><p>1. Granting Department staff's  motion for a default judgment,  holding respondent Anthony Lopatowski d/b/a Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc. in default pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15.<br/><page number="44" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.

Holding that, based upon a preponderance  of the evidence introduced at hearing, respondent Anthony Lopatowski d/b/a Safeguard Exterminating Services Inc.:</p><p>a. violated 6 NYCRR 325.23(g) five (5) times by operating a pesticides  application business during the period April 2008 through January 5, 2013 without having the requisite  pesticide  business insurance;</p><p>b. violated ECL 33-0907(1), ECL 33-1301(8-a) and 6 NYCRR 325.23(a) two (2) times by applying pesticides  during the period 2008 through January 5, 2013 without having the requisite  pesticide  business registration; </p><p>c. violated ECL 33-1301(8) thirty-one  (31) times by applying pesticides  on thirty-one  (31) occasions without possessing  the requisite  commercial pesticide  applicator  certification; </p><p>d. violated ECL 33-1205(1) and 6 NYCRR 325.25(a) thirty-one  (31) times by not maintaining pesticide  use records with respect to thirty-one  (31) pesticide  applications;</p><p>e. violated ECL 33-1205(1) and 6 NYCRR 325.25(b) five (5) times by failing to submit annual  reports to the Department during the years 2008 through 2012 during which he applied pesticides;  and</p><p>f. violated ECL 33-0903, ECL 33-1301(7) and 6 NYCRR 326.7(a) two (2) <page number="45" pageScheme="2014 N.Y.
