See Oliva Aff. P 13. Staff  also alleges that respondent performed 122 commercial pesticides  applications from January 1, 2009 to August 3, 2009. See id. P 7. These allegations are actually comprised of four distinct facts: (1) respondent<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> engaged in the commercial application of pesticides;  (2) respondent lacked the required pesticide  business registration;  (3) respondent applied pesticides  during "at least" the period from December 2008 through August 3, 2009; and (4) respondent applied pesticides  122 times. As discussed below, the record on this motion establishes only one of these facts as a matter of law. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Respondent's Business Registration </emphasis></p><p>The parties' submissions do establish as a matter of law  that respondent was not registered  prior to August 6, 2009. In support of its motion, staff  has submitted the affidavit of Julio Perez, a business registration  and certification  clerk employed by the Department. Mr. Perez states that his search of the Department's Pesticide  Business Registration  database on March 6, 2009 revealed that respondent was not registered  as a pesticide  business. See Affidavit of Julio Perez dated March 21, 2013 ("Perez Aff."), P 4. In addition, staff  has submitted a signed statement from respondent's President Ms. Advani which contains an admission that, as of July 30, 2009, the business was not yet registered.  See Affidavit of Robert Freese dated March 7, 2013 ("Freese Aff."), P 3 and<page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> Ex. A (Voluntary Statement dated July 30, 2009). Staff  has therefore submitted evidence sufficient to carry its initial burden  on the motion to demonstrate that, as a matter of law,  respondent was not registered  during the relevant time period. </p><p>In response to the motion, respondent confirms staff's  allegation that respondent was not registered  during the relevant time. Ms. Advani states that respondent was not registered  until August 6, 2009, and has submitted a copy of the registration  document reflecting that it was issued on August 6, 2009. See Response to Motion, Ex. C at 2; see also Response to Motion P 9.</p><p>The record therefore establishes as a matter of law  that respondent was not registered  until August 6, 2009. <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_27_383_25"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> Staff's  papers allege that respondent first registered  as a pesticide  business on August 4, 2009. See Oliva Aff. P 8. As discussed above, however, the documentary evidence submitted, and Ms. Advani's sworn  statement, establish as a matter of law  that the actual date of registration  was August 6, 2009.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Time Period  of Alleged Violations</emphasis></p><p>Staff  has not established as a matter of law  the time period  during which respondent allegedly applied pesticides <page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> without the required registration.  First, staff's  submissions refer to two different time  periods: (i) from January 1, 2009 to August 3, 2009. See Oliva Aff. P 7; see also Affidavit of Robert Jablonski dated March 22, 2013 ("Jablonski Aff.") P 3; and (ii) "from at least December 2008 to August 3, 2009." Oliva Aff. P 13.</p><p>Second, staff  apparently relies on what it refers to as "an electronic  version of Respondent's 2009 annual report"  as a basis for its claim that respondent applied pesticides  during the cited period. See Jablonski Aff. P 3, and Ex. B. Mr. Jablonski states that he reviewed this document on March 19, 2013. See id. P 3, but does not otherwise describe or explain the contents of the document. The six page document to which he refers is not dated, has no title, the word "pesticide"  does not appear anywhere in the document, and no reference to any year, including "2009," appears in the many lines of text and numbers in that document. See id. Ex. B. The unexplained document, the incomplete discussion in the affidavit submitted with the document, and the different time  periods set forth in staff's  papers, do not establish as a matter of law  a specific time period during <page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> which respondent allegedly applied pesticides  without a business registration. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Number of Alleged Pesticide  Applications</emphasis></p><p>Nor does the record establish as a matter of law  that respondent made 122 pesticide  applications, as alleged by staff.  See Oliva Aff. P 7; Jablonski Aff. P 3. Again, staff  relies for this assertion on the six page document attached as Exhibit B to Mr. Jablonski's affidavit. A review of the document reveals that it contains 226 lines of text and numbers. Staff  has provided no explanation of the contents of each line, nor identified which of these 226 entries allegedly relate to or establish the 122 times that respondent is alleged to have applied pesticides  without proper registration. </p><p>In addition, Department staff  witness Mr. Freese has provided the following statement regarding documents he saw during a July 30, 2009 inspection: </p><p>"I reviewed an electronic  spreadsheet  that Ms. Advani had been keeping to use as Respondent's 2009 annual report.  The entries indicated that Respondent had commercially applied pesticides  about twelve (12) times earlier in the year 2009. I also reviewed three (3) electronic  invoices  for commercial pesticides  applications that <page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> had been performed by Respondent earlier in the year 2009."</p><p>Freese Aff. P 4.</p><p>Mr. Freese's statements are problematic for several reasons. First, he has submitted neither the "electronic  spreadsheet"  to which he refers nor any of the three "electronic  invoices"  that allegedly reflect respondent's application of pesticides  in 2009. Moreover, he does not explain how he knows that Ms. Advani was "keeping" the "electronic  spreadsheet"  "to use as Respondent's 2009 annual report. " Nor does Mr. Freese explain how the entries on the spreadsheet  "indicated" that respondent, rather than someone else (such as, for example, Ms. Advani, a certified commercial pesticides  applicator)  applied pesticides. </p><p>Finally, staff  provides no explanation of the relationship, or disparity, between (i) Mr. Freese's statement that, as of July 30, 2009, the spreadsheet  he reviewed reflected that respondent applied pesticides  twelve (12) times in 2009; and (ii) staff's  other allegations that respondent applied pesticides  122 times between January 1 and August 3, 2009. <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_38_585_137"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> The record is also silent with respect to whether the "electronic   spreadsheet"  to which Mr. Freese refers, see Freese Aff. P 4, is a version of, or is otherwise related to, the "electronic  version of Respondent's 2009 annual report"  to which Mr. Jablonski refers. See Jablonski Aff. P 3.</p></bodyText></footnote> Indeed, if the document referred to by Mr. Freese was up-to-date as of his July 30th inspection,  respondent would have had to apply pesticides <page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> 110 times during the five day period of July 30 to August 3, 2009 to reach 122 applications by August 3.</p><p>Respondent has submitted a document entitled "Applicator/ Technician Pesticide  Annual Report"  that reflects a "Report Year" of 2009, and includes Ms. Advani's certification  identification number and "Bus/Agency Reg. No." 14930, which is the registration  number for respondent. See Response to Motion Ex. B. The document contains 114 entries, for what appears to be the period from January 5 through August 5, and that may reflect the application of pesticides.  Neither party discusses this document, however, and therefore its content and significance are not established for purposes of this motion.</p><p>Given the lack of clarity  in the record, staff  has not established as a matter of law  the number of times pesticides  were allegedly applied by respondent during the cited period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Whether Respondent</emphasis><page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/><emphasis typeStyle="bf"> Applied Pesticides </emphasis></p><p>Finally, staff  has not established as a matter of law  that respondent engaged in the commercial application of pesticides  before it was a registered  pesticide  business.</p><p>This enforcement matter was apparently prompted by staff's  receipt of a liability insurance certificate  for respondent which, according to Mr. Perez, "indicated that Respondent was operating as a pesticide  business in Jamaica, NY." Perez Aff. P 4. Staff  has not submitted with its motion papers a copy of the insurance certificate,  and has not explained how it "indicated" that respondent was "operating" as a pesticide  business. <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_44_691_77"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> The existence of an insurance certificate,  without more, does not establish as a matter of law  that respondent had applied or was going to apply pesticides. </p></bodyText></footnote> In addition, although Mr. Freese has stated that he saw three "electronic  invoices  for commercial pesticides  applications that had been performed by Respondent earlier in the year 2009," Freese Aff. P 4, he did not submit copies of the invoices,  state that they were on respondent's letterhead,  or otherwise explain how they support his conclusion that it was respondent that applied the pesticides. </p><p>Staff <page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> has submitted only one document containing respondent's letterhead,  a letter from respondent to Region 1 staff  received on June 21, 2011. See Jablonski Aff., Ex. A, pp. 2-3. The letter states, among other things, that "beginning January 2009 till date," Mr. Miguel Ventura, a certified applicator,  mixed,  handled  and applied pesticides  "while working under the direct supervision of the undersigned, Ms. Aruna Advani." The letter does not state that Mr. Ventura was employed by respondent during the relevant period, or that the work identified was performed for or on behalf of respondent. The letter states only that Mr. Ventura mixed,  handled  and applied pesticides  under the supervision of Ms. Advani, who is a certified applicator. </p><p>In response to staff's  motion, respondent asserts that it did not "conduct pest  control activities" prior to August 6, 2009, the date it became a registered  pesticide  business. See Response to Motion PP 4, 5, 9. Respondent's papers also contain, however, Ms. Advani's sworn  admission that she "conducted pest  control activities as a registered  Commercial Pest  Control Applicator  under my own 'Commercial Pesticide  Applicator'  License. " Id. P 4. Although this admission<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> establishes that Ms. Advani conducted pest  control activities, such admission is not inconsistent with respondent's position that respondent did not apply pesticides  before it was registered. </p><p>The parties do not disagree regarding whether pesticides  were in fact applied during the period at issue. The submissions raise a question of fact, however, as to whether the pesticides  were applied by respondent or by Ms. Advani in her individual or "independent contractor"  capacity. See Letter from A. Advani to Hon. Richard Wissler, dated October 3, 2012, attached to Response to Motion as Ex. A, at 2 (admitting that she "conducted a small number of jobs as an independent contractor" ).</p><p>For example, the record does not establish whether Ms. Advani represented to her customers that she was acting on behalf of respondent. Nor does the record contain any invoices  from, checks made payable to, or correspondence from or to, respondent during the relevant time that would establish that respondent had applied pesticides.  Given the lack of proof regarding respondent, and Ms. Advani's personal admissions, it is plausible to infer from this record that Ms. Advani, rather than respondent, performed <page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 27"/> the pesticide  applications at issue here. As set forth above, all facts must on this motion be viewed in the light most favorable  to, and all inferences must be resolved in favor of, non-movant respondent.

Martens, Commissioner</p><p>RULING</p><p>In this administrative enforcement proceeding, staff  of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("Department") alleges that American Auto Body &amp; Recovery, Inc. and Salvatore S. "Sammy" Abate ("respondents") violated the ECL, and the New York Navigation Law  ("NL") and its implementing regulations, due to the leakage of petroleum product  from a tractor-trailer.  Respondent American Auto Body &amp; Recovery, Inc., an active domestic business corporation engaged in the business of towing and repairing motor vehicles, is located at 60-05 Flushing Avenue, Maspeth, Queens, New York ("facility"). Respondent Salvatore S. "Sammy" Abate is the owner, manager and operator of American Auto Body &amp; Recovery, Inc.</p><p>Department staff  served a notice of hearing  and complaint upon respondents by certified mail on May 9, 2014 (see Affirmation  of John K. Urda in Support of Motion for Default Judgment  and Order ["Urda Affirmation" ], PP 6 and 7, and Exhibit ["Ex."] B). Department staff's  complaint alleges that, on May 16, 2012, following notice by New York City Police Department personnel of an abandoned  tractor-trailer  in Queens, respondents<page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> removed the tractor-trailer  to the facility (see Complaint P 4). The trailer,  which was leaking  petroleum product,  was stored at the facility until May 18, 2012 (see id. PP 4-5). The tractor  and trailer  were owned separately (id. P 6). On May 18, 2012, the owner of the tractor  arrived at the facility to take possession of it, but respondent Abate refused to release the tractor  without the leaking  trailer,  and advised the tractor  owner to take the trailer  and abandon it at another location (see id. PP 6, 8). The tractor  owner abandoned  the leaking  trailer  on 56th Road near 49th Street  in Queens, where the trailer  allegedly discharged waste oil onto the street  and into the New York City sewer system (see id. P 11).</p><p>The complaint asserts four causes of action,  alleging that respondents:</p><p>(1) violated ECL 71-2711(3) by releasing  to an unauthorized  person a trailer  leaking  petroleum; </p><p>(2) violated NL 173 by allowing a tractor-trailer  discharging petroleum  to be taken from the site and driven  on public highways; </p><p>(3) violated NL 175, 17 NYCRR 32.3 and ECL 17-1743 <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_13_190_97"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> Staff  did not reference a violation of ECL 17-1743 in the Wherefore Clause of its complaint and, accordingly, it is not being considered here.</p></bodyText></footnote> by failing to report to the Department the petroleum  discharge; and</p><p><page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/><br/>(4) violated NL 176 and 17 NYCRR 32.5 by failing to contain or clean up the petroleum  discharge (see Complaint PP 22-33).</p><p>The complaint requests that I issue an order finding respondents liable on each of the four causes of action  and impose on respondents a civil penalty  in the amount of $ 75,000 (see id. at 6, Wherefore Clause PP 1-5).</p><p>Respondents failed to answer the complaint, although their answer was due on or before May 29, 2014, and respondents failed to appear at the scheduled  pre-hearing  conference on June 4, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. at the Department's Region 2 offices, 47-40 21st Street,  Long Island City, New York, as set forth in the notice of hearing. </p><p>By papers dated June 4, 2014, Department staff  moved for a default judgment  and order. On June 13, 2014, Environmental Conservation Officer J. Wesley Leubner personally served the default  motion on respondents. In support of its motion for a default judgment  and order, Department staff  has submitted the Urda Affirmation,  which: (1) alleges facts relating to the causes of action;  (2) attaches proof of service of the notice of hearing  and complaint on respondents, and asserts that respondents have defaulted; (3) discusses<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> the basis for the proposed civil penalty;  and (4) attaches a proposed order. Staff  has not submitted an affidavit of any person with personal knowledge  of the facts alleged, or any other documents relating to the incident.</p><p>After service of the motion for a default judgment  and order, the matter was referred to the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services and was assigned to Administrative Law  Judge ("ALJ") P. Nicholas Garlick. ALJ Garlick prepared the attached default  summary report ("ALJ Report"). The ALJ recommends that, with respect to the first cause  of action, alleging a violation of ECL 71-2711(3), I deny staff's  motion because the statute relates to a criminal violation not appropriate for adjudication in this administrative context (see ALJ Report at 5). I adopt the ALJ's recommendation  with respect to the first cause  of action and dismiss the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p><p>The ALJ recommends that I grant Department staff's  motion for a default judgment  with respect to the second, third and fourth causes of action  alleged in the complaint (see ALJ Report at 5-6). As discussed below, I do not adopt the ALJ's recommendations  to grant a default judgment  with<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> respect to the second, third and fourth causes of action.  I deny staff's  motion for a default judgment  with respect to those causes of action,  without prejudice.</p><p>I remand the matter to the ALJ for further proceedings consistent with this ruling.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>When a respondent fails to answer or otherwise appear in response to a notice of hearing  and complaint, Department staff  may move, either orally or in writing, for a default judgment  (see 6 NYCRR 622.15). In the event Department staff  takes this course, staff  must satisfy the requirements of 6 NYCRR 622.15(b). <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_23_343_124"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> When a default judgment  motion is made in writing, in addition to the requirements of 6 NYCRR 622.15(b), staff  must also provide proof of service of the motion for a default judgment  on a respondent (see Matter of Dudley, Decision and Order of the Commissioner, July 24, 2009, at 1-2).</p></bodyText></footnote> Prior Commissioner decisions and orders are clear that, to obtain a default judgment,  staff  must also submit some proof of facts sufficient to support the claims charged in a complaint or set forth in a motion for order without hearing in lieu of complaint.</p><p>In Matter of Queen City Recycle Center, Inc. (Decision and Order of<page number="6" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> the Commissioner, December 12, 2013), I reviewed the Department's procedures when a respondent fails to appear in administrative enforcement proceedings. Consistent with the requirements applicable to default judgment  motions under the CPLR, staff  was directed to submit some proof of the facts constituting the claims charged (see id. at 3). <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_25_373_161"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> In Matter of Farmer (Decision and Order of the Commissioner, October 22, 2009), the Commissioner required submission of facts sufficient to support the claim charged in a complaint or on a motion for order without hearing in lieu of complaint enforcing petroleum  bulk storage ("PBS") facility regulations (see id. at 3 [requiring staff  to provide a copy of the facility's PBS registration (if one has been issued); the PBS facility's information report, if any; and any notice of violation]).</p></bodyText></footnote> Requiring the submission of documentary evidence to support a default judgment  is meant to assure that the record is sufficient to support the Commissioner's order in any subsequent judicial proceedings and to bring administrative default  procedures into conformity with the requirements for default  judgments under CPLR 3215 (see CPLR 3215[f]; see also <citation type="case" normalizedCite="100 N.Y.2d 62,at 70"><content>Woodson v Mendon Leasing Corp., <span normalizedCite="100 N.Y.2d 62">100 NY2d 62<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000100#000062#"/></locatorKey></locator></span>, <span normalizedCite="100 N.Y.2d 62">70-71<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#231#3#000100#000062#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> [2003]).</p><p><page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/><br/>On a review of a motion for default judgment,  it is the obligation of the ALJ to review the record and the motion papers to determine whether staff's  papers have stated a claim, and that staff's  motion, remedial relief and penalty request are supported properly (see Queen City, at 3). Such support should include, but not be limited to, one or more affidavits based upon personal knowledge  and related documents. In this matter, documents such as a spill  report form or a notice of violation, together with any other appropriate documentation relating to the incident, should also have been provided.</p><p>As set forth above, the complaint in this matter includes four causes of action.  The first cause  of action alleges that, by releasing  to an unauthorized  person a trailer  leaking  petroleum,  respondents violated ECL 71-2711(3) (see Complaint P 23). Under ECL 71-2711(3), a person who knowingly or recklessly engages in conduct which causes the release of a substance hazardous to public health,  safety or the environment, is guilty of endangering public health,  safety or the environment in the fourth degree, a class A misdemeanor.  A criminal statute such as ECL 71-2711(3) is not justiciable in<page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> this administrative forum. Staff's  motion for a default judgment  with respect to the first cause  of action is therefore denied, and the claim is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p><p>With respect to the second, third and fourth causes of action,  staff's  motion for default judgment  and order includes no proof of facts sufficient to adequately support those causes of action.  Staff  has submitted an affirmation  of counsel which alleges facts but is not based upon counsel's personal knowledge.  Staff  has submitted no affidavit of an individual with such personal knowledge,  and has submitted no documents relating to the events alleged in the complaint. Because staff  has provided no proof to support the second, third or fourth causes of action,  I do not accept the ALJ's recommendations  with respect to them. I deny staff's  motion for a default judgment  and order with respect to those causes of action,  without prejudice, and remand this matter to the ALJ for further proceedings consistent with this ruling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">NOW, THEREFORE</emphasis>, having considered this matter and being duly advised, it is <emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDERED</emphasis> that:</p><p>I.

Nicholas Garlick<br/>Administrative Law  Judge</p><p>This summary report addresses a motion for default judgment,  pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15, by staff  of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("Department staff" ) against American Auto Body &amp; Recovery, Inc. and Salvatore S. "Sammy" Abate ("respondents"). American Auto Body &amp; Recovery, Inc. is an active domestic business corporation engaged in the business of towing and repairing motor vehicles and located at 60-05 Flushing Avenue, Maspeth, Queens, New York. <page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> Salvatore S. "Sammy" Abate is the owner, manager and operator of American Auto Body &amp; Recovery, Inc.</p><p>Department staff  served a notice of hearing  and complaint upon respondents by certified mail on May 9, 2014. The respondents failed to answer, though such answer was due on or before May 29, 2014, and failed to appear at the scheduled  pre-hearing  conference on June 4, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. at DEC's Region 2 headquarters, 47-40 21st Street,  Long Island City, New York. By papers dated June 4, 2014, Department staff  moved for a default judgment  and order. This motion was personally served on respondents by Environmental Conservation Officer J. Wesley Leubner on June 13, 2014. Department staff's  motion papers included: (1) the notice of motion for default judgment  and order; (2) the motion for default judgment  and order; and (3) the affirmation  of Department staff  counsel John K. Urda. Attached to Mr. Urda's affirmation  are: (1) information from the New York State Department of State's Division of Corporation's website; (2) postal receipts indicating service of the notice of hearing  and complaint on the respondents; and (3) a proposed order.</p><p>Department staff's  complaint alleges four causes <page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> of action  related to events that occurred between May 16 and May 18, 2012, specifically, that respondents, who have a contract with the New York City Police Department to tow and store abandoned  vehicles, removed an abandoned,  stolen tractor  and trailer  to the facility at 60-05 Flushing Avenue, Maspeth, Queens, on May 16, 2012. The trailer,  which was visibly leaking  petroleum product,  was stored at the facility until May 18, 2012. That day, the separate owners of the tractor  and the trailer  were identified and the owner of the tractor  arrived at the facility to take possession of it. Mr. Abate refused to release the tractor  unless the trailer  was also removed and advised the tractor  owner to take the trailer  and abandon it at another location. The tractor  owner complied and the leaking  trailer  was abandoned  on 56th Road near 49th Street  in Queens, where it discharged waste oil onto the street  and into the New York City sewer system. The tractor  owner resolved violations of the ECL through a consent order in a separate enforcement action.</p><p>In its complaint, Department staff  alleges that the respondents violated: (1) ECL § 71-2711(3) by releasing  a trailer  leaking  petroleum  to the <page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> tractor  owner, a party unauthorized  to take possession of the trailer;  (2) Navigation Law  § 173 by allowing the leaking  trailer  to be taken from its facility and driven  on public highways;  (3) Navigation Law  § 175, Section 32.3 of 17 NYCRR, and ECL § 17-1743 by failing to report the discharge of petroleum;  and (4) Navigation Law  § 176 and section 32.5 of 17 NYCRR by failing to contain and cleanup  the discharge of petroleum. </p><p>The complaint seeks an order of the Commissioner: (1) finding respondents liable for the violations alleged in the complaint; and (2) ordering respondents to pay a civil penalty  in the amount of $ 75,000.</p><p>Default  Provisions</p><p>Subdivision 622.15(a) of 6 NYCRR (default  procedures) provides that a respondent's failure to file a timely answer, or other specified failures to respond, constitutes a default  and a waiver of a respondent's right to a hearing. Subdivision 622.15(b) of 6 NYCRR states that a motion for default judgment  must contain: "(1) proof of service upon the respondent of the notice of hearing  and complaint or such other document which commenced the proceeding; (2) proof of the respondent's failure to appear or failure to file a timely answer; and <page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> (3) a proposed order."</p><p>In Matter of Alvin Hunt d/b/a Our Cleaners (Decision and Order of the Commissioner, July 25, 2006), the Commissioner set forth the process to be followed by an administrative law  judge ("ALJ") in reviewing a default  motion. First, an examination of the proof of service of notice of hearing  and complaint is required as well as the proof of the respondent's failure to appear or file a timely answer. Then, an ALJ must consider whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted and if so, whether the penalty and any remedial measures sought by staff  are warranted and sufficiently supported.</p><p>In this case, Department staff  has met the requirements of 6 NYCRR 622.15 and the complaint sets forth a claim for which relief can be granted with respect to the second, third and fourth causes of action.  In these causes of action,  the complaint alleges that the respondents violated: (1) Navigation Law  § 173 by allowing the leaking  trailer  to be taken from its facility and driven  on public highways;  (2) Navigation Law  § 175, Section 32.3 of 17 NYCRR, and ECL 17-1743 by failing to report the discharge of petroleum;  and (3) Navigation Law  § 176 and section<page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> 32.5 of 17 NYCRR by failing to contain and cleanup  the discharge of petroleum.  Based on the information included in Department staff's  papers, Department staff  is entitled to a default judgment  in these causes of action. </p><p>With respect to the first cause  of action, Department staff  alleges that the respondents violated ECL § 71-2711(3) by releasing  a trailer  leaking  petroleum  to the tractor  owner, a party unauthorized  to take possession of the trailer  and in doing so endangered the public health,  safety or the environment in the fourth degree. The law clearly states that this violation is a class A misdemeanor.  Because the alleged violation is criminal in nature, the DEC administrative hearing process is not the appropriate forum to try this allegation. It properly belongs in criminal court. Accordingly, Department staff's  motion for default  with respect to the first cause  of action should be denied.</p><p>As the Commissioner stated Hunt, "a defaulting respondent is deemed to have admitted the factual allegations of the complaint and all reasonable inferences that flow from them [citations omitted]." Accordingly, the findings of fact set forth below are based upon the documents submitted<page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> into the record, as identified in the attached exhibit list.</p><p>Applicable Regulatory Provisions</p><p>Section 71-2711(3) of the ECL makes it a Class A misdemeanor  to knowingly or recklessly engage in conduct which causes the release to the environment of a substance hazardous to public health,  safety or the environment. Section 17-1743 of the ECL requires a person in actual or constructive possession of more than 1,100 gallons of petroleum  to immediately notify Department staff  when a spill  is discovered. Section 173 of the Navigation Law  prohibits the discharge of petroleum.  Section 175 of the Navigation Law  and 17 NYCRR 32.3 require any person with knowledge of a spill,  leak or discharge of petroleum  to report the incident to the Department immediately. Section 176 of the Navigation Law  and 17 NYCRR 32.5 require any person discharging petroleum  in a prohibited manner to undertake to clean up and remove the discharge immediately. Section 192 of the Navigation Law  provides that any person who violates any provision of Article 12 of the Navigation Law  or its implementing regulations shall be liable for a penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars per day.</p><p>Findings of Fact and<page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Respondents violated Navigation Law  § 175, Section 32.3 of 17 NYCRR, and ECL 17-1743 by failing to report the discharge of petroleum. <br/>7. Respondents violated Navigation Law  § 176 and section 32.5 of 17 NYCRR by failing to contain and cleanup  the discharge of petroleum. <br/>8. On May 9, 2014, Department staff  served the respondents with the notice of hearing  and the complaint via certified mail. The respondents' time to answer expired on or before May 29, 2014. The notice of hearing  scheduled  a pre-hearing  conference on June 4, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. at DEC's Region 2 headquarters, 47-40 21st Street,  Long Island City, New York.<br/>9. The respondents failed to answer the complaint or attend the pre-hearing  conference.<br/>10. The respondents were also served with a copy of the motion for a default judgment  and order by letter dated June 13, 2014.<br/>11. The $ 75,000 penalty and remedial and corrective relief sought by<page number="18" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> Department staff  are authorized and warranted on this record.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The record of this proceeding demonstrates that respondents violated: (1) Navigation Law  § 173 by allowing the leaking  trailer  to be taken from its facility and driven  on public highways;  (2) Navigation Law  § 175, Section 32.3 of 17 NYCRR, and ECL 17-1743 by failing to report the discharge of petroleum;  and (3) Navigation Law  § 176 and section 32.5 of 17 NYCRR by failing to contain and cleanup  the discharge of petroleum.  The record shows that respondents were served with the complaint on May 9, 2014 and did not answer the complaint. In addition, the respondents also failed to attend the prehearing conference scheduled  for June 4, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. at DEC's Region 2 headquarters, 47-40, 21st Street,  Long Island City, New York. The respondents were also served with a copy of Department staff's  motion for a default judgment  and order. The Department is entitled to a default judgment  for these violations pursuant to the provisions of 6 NYCRR 622.15.</p><p>The first cause  of action alleged by Department staff  is that the respondents violated ECL § 71-2711(3) by releasing  a trailer  leaking  petroleum  to the tractor <page number="19" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> owner, a party unauthorized  to take possession of the trailer  and in doing so endangered the public health,  safety or the environment in the fourth degree. The law clearly states that this violation is a class A misdemeanor.  Because the alleged violation is criminal in nature, the DEC administrative hearing process is not the appropriate forum to try this allegation. It properly belongs in criminal court. Accordingly, Department staff's  motion for default  with respect to the first cause  of action should be denied.</p><p>According to the affirmation  of Department staff  counsel John K. Urda the requested penalty or $ 75,000 for the four alleged causes of action  is reasonable and appropriate. In his affirmation,  Mr. Urda states that consideration was given to the Department's Civil Penalty  Policy (DEE-1, issued June 20, 1990). Mr. Urda notes that the statutory maximum civil penalty  is $ 25,000 per day, as authorized by Navigation Law  § 192 for the second, third and fourth causes of action.  In determining the appropriate requested penalty in this case, Department staff  considered the following factors: (1) the nature of the respondents' actions and failure to report the spill;  (2) the respondents' <page number="20" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> lack of cooperation in resolving this matter; (3) the respondents' relationship with the New York City Police Department; and (4) the need to deter future violations.</p><p>While Department staff  is entitled to a default  only on three of the four causes of action  alleged, all of the causes of action  relate to a single, egregious series of actions undertaken by the respondents. Given the circumstances of these violations, even though one of the causes of action  cannot be addressed in this administrative forum, based on this record, the $ 75,000 requested payable civil penalty  is authorized and appropriate.</p><p>Recommendation </p><p>Based upon the foregoing, I recommend that the Commissioner issue an order:<br/>1. granting Department staff's  motion for default,  finding the respondents in default  pursuant to the provisions of 6 NYCRR 622.15 for failing to appear at the prehearing conference and to answer the complaint;<br/>2. not finding respondents in violation of ECL § 71-2711(3) for releasing  a trailer  leaking  petroleum  to the tractor  owner, a party unauthorized  to take possession of the trailer  because this is a criminal allegation that belongs in Supreme Court.<br/>3. finding respondents in violation <page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 25"/> of: (1) Navigation Law  § 173 by allowing the leaking  trailer  to be taken from its facility and driven  on public highways;  (2) Navigation Law  § 175, Section 32.3 of 17 NYCRR, and ECL 17-1743 by failing to report the discharge of petroleum;  and (3) Navigation Law  § 176 and section 32.5 of 17 NYCRR by failing to contain and cleanup  the discharge of petroleum. <br/>4. directing respondents to pay a total civil penalty  in the amount of $ 75,000 (seventy five thousand dollars).</p><p>Dated: Albany, New York<br/>September 23, 2014</p></bodyText></decisionOpinion></opinions></administrativeDecision></administrativeDocBody><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><dc:identifier identifierScheme="PGUID">urn:contentItem:5GFV-S1G0-003Y-J0V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme="productContentSetIdentifier">5479</dc:source><dc:date dateType="last-updated">2015-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><paginationScheme pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

McBride, Administrative Law  Judge ("ALJ") of the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("Department"). The hearing addressed the allegations of Department staff  that respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. ("respondent") violated ECL 17-1009 and 6 NYCRR 612.2 by failing to renew  the registration  of its petroleum  storage facility  located at 620 West 190th Street, New York, New York ("facility"). At the facility is an aboveground petroleum  bulk storage  tank with a capacity of 3,500 gallons. </p><p>ALJ McBride prepared the attached hearing report, which I adopt as my decision in this matter, subject to my comments below. As set forth in the ALJ's hearing report, respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. failed to file  an answer to the complaint served by Department staff  in this matter, failed to appear at a pre-hearing  conference scheduled  for February 24, 2015, as directed in the cover letter  served with the notice of hearing  and complaint, and failed to appear for the adjudicatory hearing scheduled  in the matter on March <page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The notice of hearing  and complaint was actually dated January 23, 2015 and the Hearing Report is hereby corrected.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>As a consequence of respondent's failure to answer  or appear in this matter, the ALJ recommends that Department staff's  motion for default  be granted ( see Hearing Report, at 5). Pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15(b), a motion for default judgment  may be made orally  on the record or in writing and must contain:</p><p>"(1) proof of service  upon the respondent of the notice of hearing  and complaint or such other document which commenced the proceeding;</p><p>"(2) proof of respondent's failure to appear or failure to file a timely answer; and</p><p>"(3) a proposed order. "</p><p>In this matter, staff  requested that the Commissioner adopt the findings and relief contained in the wherefore clause of staff's  complaint as staff's  proposed order  ( see Hearing Report at 5 n 1). Although it is preferred that Department staff  submit a separately drafted proposed order <page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 26"/> for purposes of satisfying 6 NYCRR 622.15(b)(3), staff  may move orally  to treat specific language  in its complaint or its motion for order without hearing as the proposed order.  If staff  relies on identified provisions in its pleadings or motion as its draft order, however, those provisions must be sufficient to enable the administrative law  judge to make a finding that the requirements of 6 NYCRR 622.15(b) have been adequately met (see 6 NYCRR 622.15[c]). The ALJ so concluded here and, upon my review of the record, I agree that in this instance staff's  motion to treat specific language  in its complaint as the proposed order  satisfied 6 NYCRR 622.15(b)(3), and the 715 Heights Corp.

Accordingly, staff  is entitled to a judgment based on record evidence.</p><p>In its papers, Department staff  sought<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 26"/> a civil penalty  of ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000) ( see Staff  Ex. 1, Complaint, at Wherefore Clause P II). At the May 12, 2015 hearing, the ALJ granted staff's  motion to reduce the requested civil penalty  to five thousand dollars ($ 5,000) ( see Hearing Report, at 2). Respondent has failed to renew  the registration  of its facility since the registration  expired  on July 1, 2013, and the civil penalty  requested by staff  is authorized and appropriate ( see Matter of 12 Martense Associates LLC , Order of the Commissioner, December 19, 2011, at 2). Respondent is also directed to submit to the Department a petroleum  bulk storage  registration  application for the facility, plus applicable registration  fees, within fifteen (15) days of the service of this order upon it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">NOW, THEREFORE</emphasis>, having considered this matter and being duly advised, it is <emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDERED</emphasis> that:</p><p>I.

Moreover, based upon record evidence, respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. is adjudged to have violated ECL 17-1009<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

The complaint seeks an order of the Commissioner (1) finding respondent in violation of ECL 17-1009 and 6 NYCRR 612.2; (2) assessing a civil penalty  in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000); (3) directing respondent to renew  the registration  of its petroleum  storage facility  within fifteen (15) days of the service of the Commissioner's order upon respondent, by remitting the registration  fee set forth in ECL 17-1009(2) and a complete registration  application in accordance<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

Respondent was also served with the notice of hearing  and complaint by regular mail on January 26, 2015. Respondent failed to file  an answer to the complaint, and failed to appear at a pre-hearing  conference scheduled  for February 24, 2015, as directed in 715 Heights Corp.

Department staff  was represented by Deborah Gorman, Esq., Office of General Counsel, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, New York 12233-1500. No one appeared on behalf of respondent.</p><p>Department staff  indicated that it was prepared to proceed with the hearing, proffering a program staff  witness. Noting for the record that respondent had failed to answer the complaint, failed to appear for the pre-hearing  conference and failed to appear for the adjudicatory hearing,  Department staff  orally  moved for a default judgment  pursuant to 6 NYCRR 622.15. The ALJ reserved on the default  motion, allowing the record to remain open for Department staff  to submit the documentation required by 6 NYCRR 622.15(b). Moreover, the ALJ noted Department staff's  readiness for hearing and noted the failure of respondent to appear. The ALJ advised that the hearing, in the absence of respondent, would be convened  on a subsequent date.</p><p>On May 12, 2015, the adjudicatory hearing  was convened  before the undersigned ALJ at the Department's Central Office at 625 Broadway, Albany, New York 12233. Department staff <page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 26"/> was represented by Deborah Gorman, Esq., attorney in the Department's Office of General Counsel. Department staff  orally  renewed  its motion for a default judgment,  and also sought judgment on the merits.</p><p>Staff  also made a motion to amend  the complaint to reduce the requested penalty from ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000) to five thousand dollars ($ 5,000), in accordance with general penalty guidelines as set forth in Matter of 12 Martense Associates LLC , Order of the Commissioner, December 19, 2011, at 2 (civil penalty  of $ 5,000 is appropriate for registration  violations of less than two years' duration). Reduction of the penalty requested in the complaint in this matter does not raise the same due process concerns as would a request to increase the penalty in a default  situation ( see Matter of Reliable Heating Oil, Inc. , Decision and Order of the Commissioner, October 30, 2013, at 2-3; see also CPLR 3215[b] [default judgment  "shall not exceed in amount … that demanded in the complaint"]), and the requested reduction does not otherwise prejudice respondent. I therefore granted staff's  motion to amend  at the May 12, 2015 hearing ( see 6 NYCRR 622.5[b] ["a party may amend its <page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 26"/> pleading at any time prior to the final decision of the commissioner by permission of the ALJ … and absent prejudice to the ability of any other party to respond"]).</p><p>Department staff  called one witness, Jonathan Barker, paralegal in the Department's Office of General Counsel's Petroleum  Spill and Bulk Storage  ("PBS") Section. In all, eight (8) exhibits were received in evidence.</p><p>Applicable Regulatory Provision</p><p>Section 612.2. Registration  of facilities.</p><p>(a) <emphasis typeStyle="it">Existing facilities</emphasis>.</p><p>(1) Within one year of the effective date of these regulations,  the owner of any petroleum  storage facility  having a capacity of over 1,100 gallons  must register the facility with the department. This shall include any out-of-service facility which has not been permanently closed.</p><p>(2) Registration  must be renewed  every five years from the date of the last valid registration  until the department receives written notice that the facility has been permanently closed or that ownership of the facility has been transferred.</p><p>Findings of Fact<excerpt><bodyText><p>1. Respondent 715 HEIGHTS CORP. is the owner of a petroleum   storage facility  having a capacity of over 1,100 gallons  located at 620 West 190th Street, New<page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 26"/> York, New York ("facility"). In particular, petroleum  storage tank number 001 at the facility has a capacity of 3,500 gallons  and is located aboveground (Staff  Ex. 1, Complaint ["Compl."] P 14; see also Staff  Exs. 4, 5, and 6).<br/>2. Respondent is an active domestic business  corporation in the State of New York (Staff  Ex. 3).<br/>3. On July 25, 2008, the Department issued Petroleum   Bulk Storage  ("PBS") Certificate Number 2-283088, registering the facility, to 715 Heights Corp. (Staff  Ex. 5). This registration   expired  on July 1, 2013 ( id. ).<br/>4. Jonathan Barker is a paralegal in the Department's Office of General Counsel's Petroleum  Spill and Bulk Storage  Section who is authorized to access, search and inspect the Department's unified information system ("UIS"). The UIS is a database maintained by the Department that contains petroleum   storage facility  records filed with the Department, which records include petroleum   storage facility   registrations  filed pursuant to 6 NYCRR 612.2 (Testimony of Jonathan Barker).<br/>5. On May 4, 2015, Jonathan Barker searched the petroleum   storage facility  records contained in the Department's UIS database for any petroleum  facility registration  or renewal registration <page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 26"/> or any petroleum   storage facility  re-registration filed by respondent for the facility (Testimony of Jonathan Barker).<br/>6. As a result of his searches, Jonathan Barker determined that respondent had not renewed  the registration  of the facility at any time after the PBS certificate expired  on July 1, 2013 (Testimony of Jonathan Barker).<br/>7. As shown by Receipt for Service No. 201501300195 issued by the New York State Department of State, respondent was served on January 26, 2015, pursuant to section 306 of the Business Corporation Law with a notice of hearing  and complaint dated January 26, 2015, alleging a violation of ECL 17-1009 and its implementing regulation,  6 NYCRR 612.2, for failure to renew  the registration  of its petroleum   storage facility  located at 620 West 190th Street, New York, New York, on or before July 1, 2013. The notice of hearing  and complaint was also served on respondent by regular mail on January 26, 2015 (Staff  Ex. 2).<br/>8. Respondent failed to file  an answer to the complaint; failed to appear at a pre-hearing  conference scheduled  for February 24, 2015, as directed in the cover letter  served with the notice of hearing  and complaint; and failed to appear for the<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y.

A respondent's failure to file a timely answer "constitutes a default  and a waiver of respondent's right to a hearing" (6 NYCRR 622.15[a]). In addition, attendance by a respondent at a scheduled  pre-hearing  conference or hearing is mandatory, "and failure to attend constitutes a default  and a waiver of the opportunity for a hearing" (6 NYCRR 622.8[c]; see also 6 NYCRR 622.15[a] ["A respondent's … failure to appear at the hearing or the pre-hearing  conference … constitutes a default  and waiver of respondent's right to a hearing"]).</p><p>Upon a respondent's failure to answer  a complaint or failure to appear for a pre-hearing  conference or hearing, Department staff  may make a motion to an ALJ for a default judgment.  Such motion must contain (i) proof of service  upon respondent of the notice of hearing  and complaint; (ii) proof of respondent's failure to appear or to file a timely answer; and (iii) <page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 26"/> a proposed order  ( see 6 NYCRR 622.15[b][1]-[3]).</p><p>As the Commissioner has held, "a defaulting respondent is deemed to have admitted the factual allegations of the complaint and all reasonable inferences that flow from them" ( Matter of Alvin Hunt, d/b/a Our Cleaners , Decision and Order of the Commissioner, July 25, 2006, at 6 [citations omitted]). In addition, in support of a motion for a default judgment,  staff  must "provide proof of the facts sufficient to support the claim" ( Matter of Queen City Recycle Center, Inc. , Decision and Order of the Commissioner, December 12, 2013, at 3).</p><p>In this case, Department staff's  proof presents a prima facie case  demonstrating that respondent failed  to renew  the registration  of its petroleum  storage facility  located at 620 West 190th Street, New York, New York, on or before July 1, 2013, in violation of ECL 17-1009 and 6 NYCRR 612.2.</p><p>The record establishes that: (i) Department staff  served the notice of hearing  and complaint upon respondent; (ii) respondent failed  to file an answer to the complaint; and failed to appear at a pre-hearing  conference scheduled  for February 24, 2015, as directed in the cover letter  served with the notice  <page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 26"/> of hearing  and complaint; and (iii) respondent failed  to appear for the adjudicatory hearing  scheduled  in the matter on March 24, 2015, as directed in the notice of hearing.  The Department is entitled to a default judgment  in this matter pursuant to the provisions of 6 NYCRR 622.15.</p><p>Moreover, the proof adduced at the hearing, conducted in respondent's absence, demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that respondent failed  to renew  the registration  of its petroleum  storage facility  on or before July 1, 2013, in violation of ECL 17-1009 and 6 NYCRR 612.2.

Martens, Commissioner</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDER</emphasis></h><p>This administrative enforcement proceeding involves allegations by staff  of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("Department") that respondent James R. Smith, Jr., illegally directed loggers  to enter upon State-owned forest land, which was adjacent to his property in the Town of Malone, Franklin County, to cut and remove trees that were growing on that State land. The State land is part of the Titusville State Forest, a reforestation area outside of the Adirondack Park. This reforestation area was acquired by the State pursuant to ECL 9-0501 and is not part of the forest preserve.</p><p>Staff  personally served a notice of hearing and complaint on Mr. Smith on November 16, 2012. Staff,  in its complaint, set forth three causes of action, alleging that respondent:</p><p>(1) without legal right or permission, caused loggers  to enter State lands and cut and remove 308 trees, in violation of ECL 9-0303(1);</p><p>(2) caused the loggers  to enter on State lands and cut and remove 308 trees, in violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(g); and</p><p>(3) caused loggers  to enter State land with motorized vehicles and equipment in order to cut and<page number="2" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> remove 308 trees, in violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(m).</p><p>Respondent filed an answer dated January 7, 2013, in which he raised six affirmative defenses. After the completion of discovery and the parties' failure to reach a settlement, staff  submitted a statement of readiness dated February 13, 2014 to proceed with an adjudicatory hearing ( see Hearing Exhibit ["Exh"] C). The matter was assigned to Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") Edward Buhrmaster ( see letter dated February 24, 2014 from Chief Administrative Law Judge James T. McClymonds, Hearing Exh D). An adjudicatory hearing was convened before ALJ Buhrmaster on May 15 and 16, 2014. The ALJ prepared the attached hearing report, finding respondent liable for the alleged violations and recommending a penalty of $ 74,765.97.</p><p>I hereby adopt the ALJ's hearing report as my decision in this matter, subject to my comments below.</p><p>The ALJ, after an extensive review of the evidence relating to the boundaries of the State land and respondent's property ( see, e.g., Hearing Report at 16-21), rejected respondent's contentions that no entry on State land occurred. The ALJ found that respondent caused an entry onto State land, but determined <page number="3" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> that the number of trees cut and removed with a mechanical harvester  was 284, a figure slightly lower than staff's  allegation ( see Hearing Report at 9 [Finding of Fact 26], 10 [Finding of Fact 32]). The tire rutting at the location of the cutting  indicated heavy equipment operation in the area of the trespass  ( see, e.g., Hearing Report at 9-10 [Findings of Fact 27-29]).</p><p>The ALJ also considered each of the affirmative defenses that respondent raised. The ALJ recommended that the first three affirmative defenses (respondent's challenge to the property line,  the timing of the Department's survey, and no stated cause of action) should be disregarded on the ground that they are not affirmative defenses, and the remaining affirmative defenses (statute of limitations, res judicata and collateral estoppel) should be rejected on the merits ( see Hearing Report at 22-24). I concur with the ALJ's recommendation.</p><p>ECL 71-0703(6)(a) provides that, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, any person who violates ECL 9-0303(1) shall be liable for a civil penalty  of two hundred fifty dollars ($ 250) per tree or treble damages,  based on the stumpage  value of such tree, or both. In considering<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> the civil penalty,  the ALJ determined that the second cause of action (for the violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8[g]) was multiplicative of the first cause of action (for the violation of ECL 9-0303[1]). Accordingly, he found that separate penalties for both causes of action were not warranted ( see Hearing Report at 26), and I agree.</p><p>With respect to the civil penalty,  the ALJ recommended as follows:</p><p>--for the violations of ECL 9-0303(1), a penalty of $ 250 dollars for each of the 284 trees cut and removed ($ 250 x 284 = $ 71,000). In addition, the ALJ proposed assessing treble damages  based on the stumpage  value of the trees (that is, $ 1,221.99 x 3 = $ 3,665.97), for a total of $ 74,665.97; and</p><p>--for the violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(m)(use of motor vehicles on State land under the jurisdiction of the Department outside the forest preserve), a civil penalty  of one hundred dollars ($ 100).</p><p>The civil penalty,  combining the amounts recommended for the two violations, would be seventy four thousand seven hundred sixty-five dollars and ninety-seven cents ($ 74,765.97).</p><p>The extensive cutting  of trees on State land, respondent's indifference for and disregard of boundary lines, the loss<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> of the market value of these trees to the State, and the resulting environmental damage arising from this illegal activity warrant a significant penalty. Based on the record before me, the recommended penalty is authorized and appropriate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">NOW, THEREFORE</emphasis>, having considered this matter and being duly advised, it is <emphasis typeStyle="bf">ORDERED</emphasis> that:</p><p>I. Respondent James R. Smith, Jr. is adjudged to have violated ECL 9-0303(1) and 6 NYCRR 190.8(m) for causing the cutting  and removal  of 284 trees on State-owned forest land in the Town of Malone, Franklin County and the use of motor vehicles on State land in conjunction with the cutting  and removal  of the trees.</p><p>II. Respondent James R.

Smith, Jr., at his residence on November 16, 2012. The complaint, dated November 14, 2012, alleged that in or about November 2008, Mr. Smith caused an entry upon State-owned forest land in the Town of Malone, Franklin County, with motorized vehicles and equipment. According to the complaint, this entry resulted in the cutting  and removal  of 308<page number="7" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> trees that were growing on that land.</p><p>An answer to the complaint (Exhibit B), dated January 7, 2013, was filed on Mr. Smith's behalf by his attorney, Thomas M. Murnane of Stafford, Piller, Murnane, Kelleher &amp; Trombley, PLLC, in Plattsburgh, New York.</p><p>After the completion of discovery and the parties' failure to reach a settlement, Department of Environmental Conservation ("DEC") Staff  counsel Scott Abrahamson submitted a statement of readiness to proceed with an adjudicatory hearing (Exhibit C), consistent with Section 622.9 of Title 6 of the Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York ("6 NYCRR 622.9"), on February 13, 2014. Upon receipt of the statement of readiness at DEC's Office of Hearings and Mediation Services ("OHMS"), the matter was assigned to me by James T. McClymonds, DEC's Chief Administrative Law Judge, as confirmed by his letter of February 24, 2014 (Exhibit D).</p><p>After a conference call with the parties' counsel, I issued a notice (Exhibit E) confirming that the hearing in this matter would commence at 10 a.m. on May 15, 2014, at DEC's Region 5 office in Ray Brook, and would continue throughout that day and on May 16, 2014, to the extent necessary to<page number="8" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> complete the record. The hearing was held as scheduled on both days. Upon completion of the evidentiary record, the parties requested, and were afforded, an opportunity to submit closing briefs.</p><p>Three witnesses testified for DEC Staff:  Thomas Gliddi, DEC Region 5 forest ranger; Carolyn Wiggin, DEC Region 5 land surveyor;  and Sean Reynolds, senior forester. Mr. Smith testified, and two other witnesses testified on his behalf: Herbert Boyce, a consulting forester with Northwoods Forest Consultants, LLC, in Jay, New York; and Dean Lashway, a land surveyor  in Altona, New York.</p><p>The evidentiary record consists of a 440-page transcript compiled from the two days of testimony, as well as various documents. Attached to this hearing report is an exhibit list of the 15 documents that were presented by the parties and marked for identification; all but one (No. 9) were received in evidence. The list also includes five documents (A - E) that I took into the record myself, not as evidence but to confirm how this matter proceeded to hearing.</p><p>Rather than make oral closing statements, counsel for the parties requested an opportunity to submit post-hearing  briefs. After receiving several requested<page number="9" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> extensions of the briefing deadline, the parties submitted their post-hearing  briefs electronically on September 5, 2014.</p><p>By correspondence dated September 8, 2014, DEC Staff  counsel proposed several transcript corrections, which were not opposed by respondent. I made these corrections and subsequently proposed others after reviewing the transcript during completion of this hearing report. My proposed transcript corrections were circulated to the parties' counsel on October 23, 2014, with a directive that any objections to them be filed in writing by October 31, 2014. Because no objections were filed, the transcript now includes my corrections as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Positions of the Parties</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Position of DEC Staff </emphasis></p><p>According to DEC Staff,  Mr. Smith, without legal right or permission, directed loggers  on his property to enter upon adjacent State land, part of the Titusville State Forest, where they cut and removed 308 trees that were growing there. This is charged in a first cause of action as a violation of Environmental Conservation Law ("ECL") 9-0303(1), and in a second cause of action as a violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(g). The use of motorized vehicles and equipment to cut and remove the<page number="10" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> trees is charged separately, in a third cause of action, as a violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(m).</p><p>Pursuant to ECL 71-0703(6)(a), DEC Staff  is seeking a civil penalty  of $ 250 per tree that it alleges was cut and removed, totaling $ 77,000 ($ 250 x 308), as well as treble damages  of $ 4,335 (based on a total stumpage  value of $ 1,445 for the timber) . For the operation of motor vehicles and equipment on state lands, DEC Staff  is seeking a separate penalty of $ 100, pursuant to ECL 71-0703(1).</p><p>Combining the penalties for the various alleged violations, the total requested penalty is $ 81,435. While acknowledging this is a substantial amount, DEC Staff  says it is warranted because of Mr. Smith's alleged indifference to the correct location of the boundary between his property (which he owns with two others not charged in this matter) and property to the south (which is forest land belonging to New York State). Position of Respondent</p><p>Mr. Smith submitted an answer denying DEC Staff's  charges and pleading six affirmative defenses, which are discussed below. Mr. Smith says there is substantial and continuing confusion about the boundary between his property and the State's property to the<page number="11" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> south. Mr. Smith maintains that, at the time of the alleged incident, he had reason to believe the tree cutting  was restricted to his property, and notes that the survey on which the State relies was not performed until the year after the cutting  occurred.</p><p>Mr. Smith says that he has been in the forestry business for about 40 years, is very cognizant of how boundaries are marked in the forest, and had discussed the disputed property line with Mr. Gliddi, the DEC forest ranger, many times in conjunction with prior cuttings  performed on his property since he purchased it in 2004. He denies entering a contract with anyone to log his property in 2008, and claims the cutting  that occurred that year was approved by one of his employees, without his knowledge, on the assumption that he would not object to it, and was initiated without his knowledge. Mr. Smith acknowledges that when he learned the work had started, he consented to it, marked what he understood to be his southern property line,  and told the loggers  to cut to that line.</p><p>Mr. Smith maintains that he has no prior violations of laws or regulations governing forestry, including those enforced by DEC. Furthermore, he points out<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> that criminal charges stemming from this incident were dismissed with prejudice.</p><p>Should the Commissioner find that DEC Staff  adequately proved its charges, Mr. Smith says that no civil penalties should be imposed. Also, asserting that he had cause to believe that the land upon which the alleged trespass  occurred was his own, Mr. Smith argues that the maximum civil penalty  that should be imposed in this matter is $ 1,445.00, the stipulated stumpage  value of the trees that were removed from that land.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Findings of Fact</emphasis></p><p>1. James R. Smith, Jr., of 3055 Route 9 in Peru, New York, earns his living as a logger,  and has been in the logging  business all his life, as the owner of Smith's Logging  since 1977, and prior to that with his father, who was a logger  as well. (Smith: transcript, pages 338 and 339.)</p><p>2. Mr. Smith owns two adjacent parcels totaling more than 80 acres along the west side of Duane Road (also known as Studley Hill Road) in the Town of Malone, Franklin County. He owns these parcels (for purposes of this report, referred to collectively as the "Smith property") as a tenant in common with two other individuals, Wayne Dashnaw and Martin Hanbury, the three having purchased<page number="13" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> the parcels in 2004 from Eleanor Boyea. (Smith: transcript, page 338. See also Exhibit No. 2, a regional map  on which the area of the Smith property is highlighted; sheet  one of Exhibit No. 4, a DEC survey map  indicating the two parcels that constitute the Smith property; and Exhibit No. 7, a warranty deed  from Boyea to Smith, Dashnaw and Hanbury.)</p><p>3. The Smith property is bordered on the east by Duane Road, and on the north, west and south by State-owned land that is part of the Titusville State Forest, a reforestation area outside the Adirondack Park and the forest preserve, acquired by the State pursuant to ECL 9-0501. (Gliddi: transcript, pages 42 and 43; see also Deed,  Exhibit No. 6, at 7; Department Staff's  post-hearing  brief at 5.)</p><p>4. In the spring of 2005, while on routine patrol along Duane Road, Thomas Gliddi, a DEC forest ranger, noticed logging  operations on the Smith property, and spoke to Mr. Smith about them. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 2; Gliddi: transcript, pages 54 - 59.)</p><p>5. To ensure there were no illegal incursions onto State land, Mr. Gliddi attempted to find the boundary lines of the Smith property. He was able to locate the southeast survey monument  along<page number="14" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> Duane Road (# 1 on sheet  one of Exhibit No. 4), from which he walked west, following yellow paint on the trees, the customary method used by DEC to mark its property lines. However, he was initially unable to locate the southwest survey monument,  as the yellow painted  line, which was also posted with state forest signs, terminated in an old timber  harvest. After numerous attempts and many weeks, Mr. Gliddi was able to locate the southwest survey monument  (# 2 on sheet  one of Exhibit No. 4); however, there was no yellow paint to indicate where the southern boundary  went from it. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 3; Gliddi: transcript, pages 56 and 57.)</p><p>6. The southern property line  of the Smith property is about a half-mile long, and one cannot see from one end to the other. Walking west from Duane Road, there is a steep rise for about 200 feet, then a plateau, and then another rise followed by another plateau. (Gliddi: transcript, pages 79 - 81; Wiggin: transcript, pages 218 and 219.)</p><p>7. Using a handheld Garmin GPS unit and the Terrain Navigator computer program, Mr. Gliddi placed the southern survey monuments  and painted  the yellow boundary line  onto a topographic map  (Exhibit No. 3). <page number="15" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> It appeared to Mr. Gliddi that the yellow line (a dashed line highlighted in yellow on Exhibit No. 3) was placed in the wrong place, well south of where it should have been when the monuments  were connected by a straight line (highlighted in green on Exhibit No. 3). (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 3; Gliddi: transcript, page 58.)</p><p>8. Prior to this discovery by Mr. Gliddi, Mr. Smith had selectively cut up to the yellow-painted line that New York State had indicated was the boundary. DEC Region 5's Division of Lands and Forests was notified of the boundary line  discrepancy and timber  harvest on May 19, 2005. However, no action was taken against Mr. Smith, because he had cut up to the boundary line  that the State had indicated was its own. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 3; Gliddi: transcript, page 58.)</p><p>9. During a subsequent site inspection, Mr. Gliddi met Mr. Smith at the southwest corner monument,  where Mr. Smith was attempting to locate the western boundary of his property. Mr. Gliddi informed Mr. Smith of the southern boundary  line discrepancy and that Smith had cut onto State land. Mr. Smith told Mr. Gliddi that no further cutting  was going to occur in that area and that he was going to<page number="16" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> have his property surveyed  to establish the boundary line  and therefore get the most out of his investment. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 3; Gliddi: transcript, pages 58 and 59.)</p><p>10. From the spring of 2005 to the spring of 2007, Mr. Gliddi made periodic inspections of the State boundary lines around the Smith property. Although timber  harvesting still occurred on the Smith property, there was no further activity in the area of the southern boundary  line or any apparent incursions onto State land. Mr. Gliddi attempted to locate the southern boundary  line, walking between the corner monuments  with a compass. However, the line was always bowed southward onto State land, as Mr. Gliddi determined by use of the track log of his State-issued Garmin GPS and Terrain Navigator computer program. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 4.)</p><p>11. During the summer of 2007, Mr. Gliddi had discussions with Mr. Smith at his property. Mr. Smith told Mr. Gliddi that he wanted to do further cutting  along the southern portion of his property and that he wanted to know where he could cut. Mr. Gliddi told Mr. Smith that it was his responsibility to know where his property lines were but that he would flag a rough estimate<page number="17" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> of the boundary line,  erring onto the Smith property to prevent cutting  onto State land. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 5; Gliddi: transcript, page 59.)</p><p>12. On July 6, 2007, after obtaining approval from DEC Region 5, Mr. Gliddi marked an approximate boundary line  location with flagging  consisting of pink,  non-biodegradable ribbons tied at eye level around tree trunks and branches, so that one could see from one ribbon to the next. He told Mr. Smith that this flagging  represented a crude estimate of the line's location and that he had erred onto the Smith property so as to prevent encroachment upon State land. The pink-flagged line was put in place by use of Mr. Gliddi's State-issued Garmin GPS, using the Terrain Navigator computer program to ensure the pink  line was indeed on the Smith property. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 5; Gliddi: transcript, pages 59 - 63.)</p><p>13. On November 25, 2008, while on routine patrol along Duane Road, Mr. Gliddi observed equipment from Robert Butts Logging  loading logs onto a truck at the Smith property. (An "x" on Exhibit No. 3 indicates where this activity occurred.) (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 6; Gliddi: transcript, pages 64 and 65.)</p><p>14. Mr. Gliddi stopped<page number="18" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> to talk to the job supervisor, John Joy, an employee of the logging  company, about the southern boundary  discrepancy. Mr. Joy said that Mr. Smith had told Mr. Butts about the discrepancy, and that during the week of November 10, 2008, Mr. Smith had worked on-site to determine what he thought was the location of the boundary line,  which he had painted  on the trees in orange.  (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 6; Gliddi: transcript, pages 66, 94 and 95.)</p><p>15. Mr. Joy told Mr. Gliddi that Mr. Smith had indicated to him that the pink  flagging  Mr. Gliddi had placed in 2007 was incorrect and that the logging  company should harvest up to the orange  painted  line, which Mr. Joy said the company had begun to do. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 6; Gliddi: transcript, page 66.)</p><p>16. Inspecting the logging operation,  Mr. Gliddi noted that some of his pink  flagging  remained near the southeast corner of Smith's property, but that further west the flagging  was missing. He also used his Garmin GPS to locate the survey markers and orange  painted  line, which bowed southward, south of the pink  line he had put in. He told Mr. Joy that he thought there were problems with the southern boundary  and that further cutting <page number="19" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> should be avoided in this area. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 6; Gliddi: transcript, pages 67 - 69 and 95.)</p><p>17. Using the Terrain Navigator computer program, Mr. Gliddi then determined that the orange  painted  line encroached upon the State forest in certain sections where the logging  company had already harvested up to that line. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 6; Gliddi: transcript, page 68.)</p><p>18. On November 30, 2008, Mr. Gliddi notified Mr. Butts of this determination, to which Mr. Butts responded that his crew had just followed the property line  indicated by Mr. Smith. Mr. Butts then assured Mr. Gliddi that he would do no further work in the area of encroachment until the boundary line  issue was resolved. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 6; Gliddi: transcript, pages 69 and 97.)</p><p>19. On December 1, 2008, Mr. Gliddi informed DEC's Region 5 Division of Lands and Forests about the potential trespass  onto State forest land from the Smith property, adding that a survey was needed to determine the extent of any encroachment. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 7; Gliddi: transcript, pages 69 and 70.)</p><p>20. In March and April 2009, a survey of the boundaries between the Smith property and the State forest was<page number="20" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> conducted by DEC's Bureau of Real Property. As part of the survey, the corner monuments  of the Smith property (# 1 to # 6) were located and identified (as shown on sheet  one of Exhibit No. 4) and the area of State property on which recent logging  had occurred (highlighted on sheet  2 of Exhibit No. 4, beyond the southern boundary  of the Smith property) was established to be about 1.87 acres. (Wiggin: transcript, pages 141 - 152.)</p><p>21. DEC's survey maps,  dated May 13, 2009, were drafted by Carolyn Wiggin and signed by Floyd Lampart, both DEC land surveyors.  Because their survey had good closure, indicated by the negligible error between the original and final coordinate values, the resulting maps  have a high degree of reliability. (Wiggin: transcript, pages 152 - 154.)</p><p>22. Furthermore, sheet  1 of DEC's survey maps  closely replicates a 1980 survey map  of the Smith property (Exhibit No. 5) that was prepared by Dana L. Drake on behalf of Gerald and Bernice Shannon, prior landowners who sold to Ms. Boyea. The Drake survey map  is referred to in Exhibit No. 7, the deed  from Boyea to Smith, Dashnaw and Hanbury. After reviewing this deed,  DEC Staff  retrieved the map  from Mr. Drake and used<page number="21" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> it to identify the monuments  he had set. Upon locating the monuments,  Staff  took its own measurements, which were then incorporated into its own survey maps.  (Wiggin: transcript, pages 155 - 175.)</p><p>23. While conducting their survey, DEC's surveyors  found more than 10 trees with survey-type blazes along what they determined to be the southern boundary  of the Smith property, which is identified as a green-highlighted line on sheet  1 of Exhibit No. 4. (Sheet  2 of Exhibit No. 4, which shows detail along the southern boundary,  indicates the locations of deciduous and coniferous trees on which the blazes were found.) (Wiggin: transcript, pages 154 - 156.)</p><p>24. By hacking into one of the blazed trees to assess its growth since the blazing occurred, DEC's surveyors  determined that the blazes had been made about 30 years earlier, likely by Mr. Drake, to indicate the location of the property boundary. (Wiggin: transcript, pages 154 - 156.)</p><p>25. On May 18, 2009, DEC senior forester Sean Reynolds, escorted by Mr. Gliddi and working with other DEC foresters, performed a stump  tally  in the area of the alleged 2008 timber  trespass.  (Reynolds: transcript, pages 228 - 231.)</p><p>26. DEC Staff  determined<page number="22" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> that 308 trees had been cut and removed, as reflected in the three pages of tally  sheets  included in Exhibit No. 8. However, on the complete hearing record, I find that 284 trees had been cut and removed, as discussed further below.</p><p>27. During the May 18, 2009, site visit, Mr. Reynolds observed tire rutting indicative of heavy equipment operation in the area of the trespass,  as well as turning up of the ground indicative of something having being pulled or dragged across the surface. (Reynolds: transcript, pages 239 and 240.)</p><p>28. The ground disturbance was consistent with operation in the trespass  area of a log skidder and a large mechanized harvester.  A mechanized harvester  (or feller buncher) employs a shear, or "hot saw," which is a rotating circular blade that cuts trees at the stump  level, while at the same time grasping them in a pair of pinchers, which allows the equipment operator to place the cut trees in whatever location the operator chooses, to make it easier for the skidder to pick them up. (Reynolds: transcript, pages 241 - 243.)</p><p>29. The skidder tracks observed by Mr. Reynolds crossed multiple times between the State land trespass  area and the Smith property, along<page number="23" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> the Smith property's southern boundary  as determined by the DEC survey. (Reynolds: transcript, pages 247 and 248.)</p><p>30. Observing from the State land trespass  area, Mr. Reynolds saw that everything on the Smith property, at a distance as far as 200 or 300 yards from the State's property line,  had been cut in some manner, some areas more heavily than others. (Reynolds: transcript, pages 249 and 250.)</p><p>31. On July 12, 2010, Herbert Boyce, a forester hired by Mr. Smith, performed his own stump  tally  in the 1.87-acre area where the alleged timber  trespass  occurred. (Boyce: transcript, page 113.)</p><p>32. According to his report (Exhibit No. 10) prepared after this field work, Mr. Boyce counted and measured 294 stumps  in this area: 284 stumps  that he concluded were cut by a mechanical harvester  with a circular saw head, in November and December 2008, the time of the alleged violations; and 10 stumps  he concluded were cut by a chain saw  prior to that period but since 2004, when Mr. Smith purchased his property. (Exhibit No. 10; Boyce: transcript, pages 114 - 117.)</p><p>33. Based on seven comparable timber  sales conducted around the time of the 2008 harvest, Mr. Boyce concluded that the total<page number="24" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> stumpage  value for the trees cut in 2008 by a mechanical harvester  was $ 1,221.99, and that the total stumpage  value for the trees cut by chain saw  was $ 223.05. (Exhibit No. 10.)</p><p>34. In addition, Mr. Boyce observed stumps  from what he concluded was the cutting  of trees by chain saw  prior to 2004, which he did not count or measure, because the cutting  was presumed to predate Mr. Smith's property purchase. (Exhibit No. 10; Boyce: transcript, page 115.)</p><p>35. There was evidence of rot in many of the stumps  reviewed in both parties' stump  tallies,  and this rot would have reduced the value of trees affected by it. (Reynolds: transcript, page 262; Boyce: transcript, pages 115 and 122.)</p><p>36. Overall, the timber  removed from the trespass  area was not of high quality, and there was better-quality, more mature timber  further south on the State land, outside the trespass  area. (Boyce: transcript, pages 135 and 136.)</p><p>37. Mills will buy only fairly solid trees, while trees exhibiting excessive decay are sold as pulp wood or firewood. (Boyce: transcript, page 123.)</p><p>38. According to Mr. Smith, the logs resulting from the cutting  in November 2008 went to Tupper Lake Hardwoods, and a lot of<page number="25" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> the firewood generated by the cutting  was sold locally, with some being brought to Keeseville. (Exhibit No. 15.)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>This matter involves charges that Mr. Smith caused the cutting  and removal  of 308 trees on State land, part of the Titusville State Forest, in conjunction with a logging operation  on his own neighboring property in November 2008. To prove the charges, DEC presented testimony from Forest Ranger Gliddi, who witnessed the logging;  Ms. Wiggin, who surveyed  the lines between the Smith property and the property owned by the State; and Mr. Reynolds, who participated in a stump  tally  to calculate the value of the timber  that was removed.</p><p>In his answer, Mr. Smith acknowledged his property ownership, which is shared with two other individuals, but denied DEC Staff's  charges. Having reviewed the full record, I conclude that DEC Staff  proved its charges by a preponderance of evidence, though I find that 284 trees were cut and removed with a mechanical harvester,  adopting the number presented in Mr. Boyce's report. Furthermore, I find that there was an entry onto State land, and that Mr. Smith caused this entry to occur.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Involvement of Mr. Smith in Alleged Violations</emphasis><br/><page number="26" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/><br/>In its complaint, DEC Staff  alleged that Mr. Smith, without legal right or permission, caused a logging  company to enter upon the State forest and to cut and remove trees that were growing there. DEC Staff's  evidence of the logging,  and of Mr. Smith's direction of the activity, consisted of the testimony and written statement of Mr. Gliddi, who observed equipment from Robert Butts Logging  Company on Mr. Smith's property on November 25, 2008, while Gliddi was on routine patrol along Duane Road.</p><p>According to Mr. Gliddi, Mr. Joy, the job supervisor, told him that Mr. Smith had been to the property during the week of November 10, 2008, and had painted  in orange  what Smith understood to be his southern property line.  Mr. Joy told Gliddi that Smith had then instructed Joy to harvest up to that line, which was south of the pink-flagged line that Gliddi had previously established.</p><p>At the hearing, Mr. Smith denied entering into a contract with anyone to log on his property during 2008, and said he did not learn that the logging  was actually happening until about November 1, 2008, after a hospital stay. (Transcript, page 353.) Mr. Smith said that, during his hospitalization, he was visited<page number="27" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> by Dale Estes, an individual who was working for him at that time. (Transcript, pages 354 and 410.) According to Mr. Smith, Mr. Estes asked about having Mr. Butts do some logging  on Smith's property, since Butts was looking for a month's work. (Transcript, pages 354 and 411.) Mr. Smith said that he told Mr. Estes he would "think about it," but that Mr. Estes interpreted this as "yes," and that Butts was already working at the property when Mr. Smith was released from the hospital. (Transcript, pages 354 and 411.) Mr. Smith said it would not be accurate to say that he asked Mr. Butts to cut wood on his property, but that Butts was not a trespasser either, because Mr. Estes gave him permission to do so. (Transcript, pages 409 and 410.)</p><p>Mr. Smith explained that Mr. Estes had assumed Smith would have no problem with Mr. Butts logging  the property because Butts had worked for Smith before, and because Smith had talked about "getting someone to come in" to the property and chip a lot of low-grade timber  there. (Transcript, page 410.) Mr. Smith said that when he learned the work had started, he went to the property and told Butts to stop cutting  and leave, "but I calmed down after a while, <page number="28" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> and said, okay, you're already here. I was going to have this section sent out and it's mostly chipped wood. I was going to have somebody do it anyway, so here, you might as well do it." (Transcript, page 411.)</p><p>Mr. Smith said it was only at this point, in November 2008, that he gave Mr. Butts permission to cut wood on his property, more particularly, in the southeast section, which he described as overgrown pasture land. (Transcript, pages 411 and 412.) Mr. Smith acknowledged that he put orange  paint on some of the trees on what he thought to be his southern boundary  line, and marked the line with orange  flagging  as well. (Transcript, pages 354, 355 and 413.) He said that he walked the property with Mr. Butts and his harvester,  Mr. Joy, pointing out the orange  paint and flagging  as the boundary of the State land, and telling them to stop cutting  at that boundary. (Transcript, pages 412 - 414.)</p><p>Mr. Smith's testimony that it was Mr. Estes, not himself, who initially approved the logging operation,  and that he was not aware of the operation until after it started, was unconvincing in several respects. First, Mr. Smith did not present Mr. Estes as a witness to corroborate this testimony. <page number="29" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> Second, it is unreasonable to think that Mr. Estes would have allowed the operation without Smith's approval, or while Smith was still considering the proposal. Third, during Mr. Smith's cross-examination, DEC Staff  counsel presented a typewritten statement (Exhibit No. 15) which bears Smith's signature, indicating that he "got" Mr. Butts to come up in October 2008, that Butts "was going to do some cutting  for me," and that Smith "advised him [Butts] and his man John [Joy] that there could be a problem with the south line," which Smith said he then painted  orange. </p><p>Mr. Smith acknowledged his signature on the statement, as well as his initials at the end of it. (Transcript, pages 396 - 399.) However, he denied familiarity with the statement itself, which was part of the file in the related criminal matter. Mr. Smith said that a DEC criminal investigator, Ken Bruno, made a handwritten statement from a conversation with him, but that he never had a chance to read that statement and was not presented with a typewritten statement at any time. (Transcript, pages 396 - 398.) He said the typewritten statement, which is dated February 19, 2009, contains "a lot of mistakes" that he would have<page number="30" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> corrected had he seen it before. (Transcript, page 405.) When I asked if he could explain why his signature appeared on the statement, Mr. Smith said he thought the signature had been forged. (Transcript, pages 405 - 407.) However, he offered no support for this contention, and I do not deem it credible.</p><p>Counsel for Mr. Smith objected to receipt of the typewritten statement, since Mr. Smith claimed he had never before seen it, and because it was not sworn and notarized. (Transcript, pages 399 and 400.) However, I received it on the basis that it had been sufficiently authenticated as a statement made in the context of the criminal case. (Transcript, pages 403 and 404.) In fact, Mr. Smith's counsel acknowledged that he had received a copy of the statement from the Franklin County District Attorney's office as part of his own discovery in the criminal matter, and that he later produced a copy of it pursuant to DEC Staff  counsel's demand in February 2013 for "each and every statement made by any witnesses relating in any way to the allegations set forth in the Department's complaint, whether oral, written, transcribed, or otherwise recorded, signed or unsigned and regardless of how<page number="31" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> obtained." (Transcript, pages 417 - 419.)</p><p>DEC Staff  counsel said that he subsequently learned that Mr. Bruno was involved in preparing the statement, and saw it in Mr. Bruno's file. (Transcript, page 417.) According to DEC Staff  counsel, Exhibit No. 15 was represented by Mr. Bruno to be the original typewritten statement, which DEC Staff  counsel said he was given three days before this hearing started. (Transcript, pages 417 - 419.)</p><p>As Mr. Smith's counsel points out, the statement is not sworn to or notarized. However, it is recorded on a form that states it "need be sworn only if court specifically requires oath." Sworn or not, it is relevant, for impeachment purposes, as a prior statement that is inconsistent with Mr. Smith's testimony that he was not aware of the logging operation  when it began, and that the operation was initially approved not by himself, but by Mr. Estes.</p><p>More pertinent to the charges, the statement is also relevant as Mr. Smith's admission that he determined how far south the logging  would proceed. After all, the logging  of Smith's own property was not illegal; the only illegality was the incursion onto the adjacent State land.</p><p>According to Smith's statement, <page number="32" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> he advised Butts and Joy "that there could be a problem with the south line. I told them I would mark the line and I painted  it with orange  paint. . . I told [them] to cut to the orange  line." This portion of the statement is consistent with the account that Joy gave Gliddi on November 25, 2008, when Gliddi first encountered the logging operation. </p><p>In his statement, Mr. Smith also says that his orange  painted  line followed flags that he and Gliddi had previously placed. However, Mr. Gliddi testified that, in the area of the State land incursion, the orange  painted  line was south of the pink  line that Gliddi had flagged in July 2007, and that, due to the logging,  some of the trees with pink  flagging  had been removed. (Transcript, pages 67 and 68.)</p><p>According to Mr. Smith's statement, Mr. Gliddi had done his flagging  "four or five years ago" and a lot of Gliddi's flags had "fallen off" the trees before Smith painted  the orange  line. However, Mr. Gliddi testified that his flagging  was done only one year earlier, and that the flags were biodegradable plastic "firmly attached" by square knots to tree trunks or branches, such that they would have been expected to last "for quite a while." <page number="33" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> (Transcript, pages 62 and 93.) Mr. Gliddi acknowledged that flagged branches can blow down from snow or wind, but also said that where he had flagged boundary lines when he first came to the area in 2000, the flagging  "is still there today." (Transcript, page 62.)</p><p>The fact that Smith did not intend his orange   painted  line to match Gliddi's pink  flagged line is underscored by Gliddi's affidavit, which recounts his conversation with Mr. Joy. According to the affidavit, Mr. Smith told Mr. Joy that the pink   flagging  Gliddi had placed in 2007 was incorrect and that the loggers  should harvest up to the orange   painted  line, which Mr. Smith had determined was the true southern boundary  of his property.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Entry onto State Land</emphasis></p><p>The record demonstrates not only Mr. Smith's direction of the 2008 logging operation,  but the incursion of that operation onto forest land owned by the State. The entry onto State land was shown by the testimony of Ms. Wiggin, the DEC surveyor  who became involved in this matter in March 2009. Ms. Wiggin was asked to find the property line  along the State land, so it could be determined whether that land was affected by the logging.  (Transcript, page 141.)</p><p>With<page number="34" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> two other surveyors  - her colleague Doug Hazelden and supervisor Floyd Lampart - Ms. Wiggin performed the field work for the two survey maps  received as Exhibit No. 4. Ms. Wiggin ran the survey instrument that electronically measured the distances and angles around the Smith property, and entered the field information into the computer, allowing her to draft the two sheets  that were then signed by Mr. Lampart. (Transcript, page 143.) The first sheet  of Exhibit No. 4 shows the boundaries of the Smith property, and the second sheet  shows detail along the southern boundary  of that property, where the violations occurred.</p><p>As Ms. Wiggin explained, the surveyors  established the boundaries of the Smith property, where that boundary is not formed by Duane Road, by locating the corner monuments  and then drawing lines from one to the next. The corner monuments,  consisting of metal pipes or bars, were found by reference to a map  (Exhibit No. 5) that was developed as part of a 1979 survey conducted by Dana Drake, which is referenced in the Smith deed  (Exhibit No. 7). (Transcript, page 165.) Mr. Drake surveyed  the property for Gerald and Bernice Shannon (transcript, pages 158 and 159), who later<page number="35" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> sold it to Eleanor Boyea, from whom Mr. Smith and his partners then acquired it. (Transcript, page 164.)</p><p>Using Mr. Drake's survey map,  Ms. Wiggin testified that it took two or three days for her survey team to find the corner monuments  that Drake had set, which stand no more than a foot or two above the ground. (Transcript, page 152.) The southern boundary  was then established as the line highlighted in green between monument  # 1, in the southeast corner, and monument  # 2, in the southwest corner, on the first sheet  of Exhibit No. 4 (the DEC survey map)  and also on Exhibit No. 5 (the Drake map) .</p><p>Sheet  1 of DEC's survey maps  closely replicates the Drake map  because they are both derived from the same monuments.  As Ms. Wiggin explained, the bearings and distances of the lines drawn on the DEC survey map  are not significantly different from those recorded on the Drake map  and the Smith deed  (transcript, page 175), although DEC's standard is to run clockwise around a parcel, whereas Mr. Drake went counterclockwise instead. (Transcript, page 167.) Therefore, on Drake's map  the green highlighted line is designated as south 85 degrees 58 minutes east, and on DEC's map  that same line <page number="36" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> is labelled as north 85 degrees 58 minutes west, "northwest being the same as southeast just travelling in the opposite direction," as Ms. Wiggin explained. (Transcript, page 167.)</p><p>DEC's survey maps  include a highlighted area, south of the Smith property, representing approximately 1.87 acres of State land that the survey team determined had been recently logged. According to Ms. Wiggin, she and her colleagues traversed that area, setting up survey instruments and measuring angles and distances. (Transcript, pages 147 and 148.)</p><p>As Ms. Wiggin explained, the State acquired the land south of the Smith property from Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. in 1950, as evidenced by a deed  received as Exhibit No. 6. (Transcript, page 170.) Ms. Wiggin said that she reviewed the property description in that deed  to verify the boundary between the Smith property and the State land, and that the deed  confirmed the survey that was later conducted by Mr. Drake. (Transcript, pages 170 - 173.) She also said that Schedule "A" of Mr. Smith's own deed  (Exhibit No. 7) provides a good description of his property boundaries in terms of bearings and distances, one that matches the information on the Drake survey<page number="37" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> map  (Exhibit No. 5).</p><p>Ms. Wiggin said that, in her professional opinion, the Smith deed  accurately describes the boundary between his property and State land to the south, and there is no reason to dispute that description or Mr. Drake's survey work, on which the description is based. She added that her research uncovered no records that the boundary had been disputed in the three decades since the Drake survey was completed. (Transcript, pages 176 and 177.)</p><p>In summary, Ms. Wiggin's survey maps  (Exhibit No. 4) highlight the entry onto State land which is the basis of DEC Staff's  charges. These maps'  depiction of Mr. Smith's southern property line  is consistent with that line's depiction in the map  prepared by Mr. Drake (Exhibit No. 5), whose survey forms the basis of the property description in Mr. Smith's deed  (Exhibit No. 7).</p><p>To rebut Staff's  charges, Mr. Smith offered testimony from another surveyor,  Dean Lashway, who suggested that the actual property line  might be south of that surveyed  by DEC Staff,  along the line of an old barbed wire fence  buried in the duff just below the ground surface. Remnants of this fence  line, extending east and west of the logged area, are highlighted<page number="38" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> in yellow marker on sheet  2 of Exhibit No. 4, which indicates that the fencing was discovered 0.4 feet beneath the duff. Were this recognized as the actual property line,  the logging  would have caused virtually no incursion onto State land, as Mr. Lashway pointed out in his testimony. (Transcript, page 307.)</p><p>Mr. Lashway testified that a portion of the same fence  line is also shown on Mr. Drake's survey map  (Exhibit No. 5), where it is similarly highlighted, and that close to that line is a point just east of monument  # 2, the surveyed  southwestern corner of the Smith property, where Mr. Drake found a pin, which is described in DEC Staff's  survey maps  as an iron pipe standing 2 feet tall in stones 12.55 feet south of the line that Staff  surveyed.  (Transcript, pages 299- 301.)</p><p>Mr. Lashway said the location of the pin and the location of the fence  line, at the point where it crosses Mr. Smith's western property line,  both likely had a role in fixing where Mr. Drake set monument  # 2 during his survey work in 1979. (Transcript, pages 300 and 301.) Furthermore, he said that, in his opinion, the fence  line may represent a title line that existed prior to the State acquiring its property<page number="39" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> in great lots No. 10 and No. 15, as depicted on Exhibit No. 11, which Ms. Wiggin described as a deed  plot prepared in 1882. (Wiggin: transcript, page 207; Lashway: transcript, pages 302 - 304.)</p><p>Mr. Lashway said that, on Exhibit No. 11, this title line is the uppermost green-highlighted line, dividing great lot No. 10 more or less in half from east to west and then crossing into the center of lot No. 15. (Transcript, pages 303 and 304.) He also identified the line as a property boundary described in a 1925 deed  (Exhibit No. 12) that is referenced in the 1950 deed  between Niagara Mohawk and the State of New York (Exhibit No. 6). (Transcript, pages 307 - 322.)</p><p>The southwest, northwest and northeast corners of Lot No. 10 are shown both on the Drake survey map,  and on sheet  one of DEC's survey maps,  as points 2A, 3 and 4A, respectively. According to the first paragraph of the schedule attached to Mr. Smith's deed  (Exhibit No. 7), Parcel I of his property is "situate" in the north half of Lot No. 10, and bounded on the south by the south half of that lot. However, as Mr. Lashway explained, Mr. Drake's survey did not split the lot equally from north to south, since the western boundary<page number="40" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> of Mr. Smith's share of the parcel is 1405.80 feet in length, while the western boundary of the State's share, to the south, is 1234.20 feet in length.</p><p>Mr. Lashway attributed this discrepancy to the role of the fence  line traversing the lot in an east-west direction. (Transcript, pages 298 - 300.) He acknowledged that Mr. Smith's southern property boundary, as surveyed  by Mr. Drake, does not correspond to the fence  line shown on Drake's map.  However, he added that if the fence  line, as ancient evidence of an earlier boundary, were accepted as the current boundary as well, it is "very likely" that the area between the fence  line, as extended across Lot No. 10, and the surveyed  line (in essence, the logged area at issue in this matter) "could be owned by someone other than the State of New York," possibly by Mr. Smith and his partners. (Transcript, pages 321 - 323.)</p><p>Speaking for DEC Staff,  Ms. Wiggin de-emphasized the significance of the barbed wire fence,  which she said her survey team had located with a metal detector. (Transcript, page 188.) She said it was "not necessarily for a surveyor  to decide if it's a boundary," adding that the fence  could merely represent a "possession<page number="41" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> line," meaning "evidence as far as where people may have occupied to," based on their understanding as to where one property ended and another began. (Transcript, page 191.) There is no mention of the barbed wire fence  in the deeds  presented by the parties, nor did Mr. Drake appear as a witness to explain its significance to him.</p><p>Convincingly, Ms. Wiggin explained that an old barbed wire fence  could, in some cases, be the best evidence of a property boundary line,  but only if there are no corner monuments  and the fence  runs generally in a straight line. Here, she said, the fence  line bows out from the corners of the property, and, more important, there are "bearings and distance calls, and monuments,  manmade monuments  that we found," all referenced in Mr. Smith's deed,  from which the southern property boundary could be reliably ascertained. (Transcript, pages 190, 208 and 217.)</p><p>Ms. Wiggin described a hierarchy of evidence used by surveyors  that prioritizes monumented lines, as called for in deeds,  when determining property boundaries. Such evidence, she said, is more reliable than descriptions based on adjoining landowners or acreage. (Transcript, page 216.)</p><p>Because, for the<page number="42" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> property boundary at issue, the deed  had bearing and distance calls, and references to man-made monuments  that were found in the field, Ms. Wiggin said DEC Staff  relied on this information in drawing its line. (Transcript, page 217.) She stressed that, for a private landowner like Mr. Smith, DEC Staff  prefers to rely on information in the owner's own deed  (in this case, from Mr. Drake's survey work) so as not to stir up trouble, especially where, as here, that information has been accepted for 30 years. (Transcript, pages 212 and 217.)</p><p>In its post-hearing  brief, DEC Staff  argues convincingly that Mr. Smith cannot rely on his deed's  archaic description of his property as being the north half of Lot No. 10, based on an 1891 deed  and a map  of similar vintage. DEC Staff  also points to language in his deed  that the premises are conveyed "expressly subject to . . . any state of facts which an accurate survey would show." Because Mr. Smith's deed  contains a modern description of Parcel I drawn directly from the survey prepared by Mr. Drake in 1979, Staff  maintains - correctly, in my opinion - that the deed  forecloses any other interpretation of the parcel that is contrary to that description<page number="43" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> and Mr. Drake's survey map. </p><p>In his testimony, Mr. Gliddi said that he had asked in 2005 that DEC's Division of Lands and Forests survey Mr. Smith's southern property line,  due to logging  that Smith was then doing near it. (Transcript, page 84.) Ms. Wiggin said she was not personally aware of this, though she added such requests would have been directed to and handled by her supervisor, Mr. Lampart. (Transcript, page 213.)</p><p>Ms. Wiggin emphasized that DEC receives many similar requests - from its own staff  as well as from neighboring landowners - to survey State property boundaries, but has a tremendous backlog, and "we have many requests that languish for years because we don't have the staff  to do every request that comes in." (Transcript, page 213.) She added that mapping the boundary between the State's land and Mr. Smith's property was a priority when she received the assignment in 2009, but only because of the possibility that a timber  trespass  had occurred during the previous year. (Transcript, pages 214 and 215.)</p><p>Correctly, Ms. Wiggin stressed that private owners are responsible to survey and mark their property boundaries before cutting  against the State, especially where<page number="44" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> the indicators in the field are confusing. (Transcript, page 217.) Likewise, Mr. Lashway said that, without a doubt, he would recommend a survey of Mr. Smith's southern property boundary, given the conflict between the fence  line and the monumented line on Mr. Drake's survey map.  (Transcript, pages 333 and 334.) Even Mr. Smith, speaking to Mr. Gliddi in 2005, said he was going to have the boundary surveyed,  so he could make the most of his property investment. (Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 3.) Had he done this, the subsequent timber   trespass  might have been avoided.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Affirmative Defenses</emphasis></p><p>Apart from denying DEC Staff's  charges, Mr. Smith claimed six affirmative defenses in his answer to the complaint. To understand the facts and theory supporting these defenses, I led the parties' counsel through a discussion of each of them prior to the hearing's conclusion. (Transcript, pages 425 to 436.) DEC Staff  also responded to the defenses in its post-hearing  brief. For the reasons stated below, the Commissioner should disregard the first three affirmative defenses, and should strike the others.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">First Affirmative Defense - Property Line  Dispute</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Smith claims that the common property<page number="45" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> line between his property and that of the State, on his southern border, remains in dispute. According to DEC Staff,  the property line  is that between monuments  # 1 and # 2, as shown on sheet  one of Exhibit No. 4. However, Mr. Lashway, a witness for Mr. Smith, suggests that the line may be further south, along the course of a buried barbed wire fence,  as shown on sheet  two of Exhibit No. 4. (Transcript, pages 332 and 333.)</p><p>I find that the actual property line  is the one identified by DEC Staff.  Staff's  line is supported by the testimony of Ms. Wiggin, and is consistent with the line drawn and apparently blazed by Mr. Drake, whose survey is referenced in Mr. Smith's deed. </p><p>At any rate, Mr. Smith's challenge to the property line  is not an affirmative defense to the charges. Instead, it is the basis for his denial of liability, because, if the line were represented by the barbed wire fence,  one could argue there was no trespass  onto State property, and therefore no illegal cutting. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Second Affirmative Defense - Timing of DEC Survey</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Smith claims that DEC Staff's  survey maps  were not completed until after his alleged trespass,  an assertion not disputed by DEC Staff.  In fact, <page number="46" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> the maps  themselves are dated May 13, 2009, seven months after the alleged violations, which are charged to have occurred in or about November 2008.</p><p>DEC's survey was conducted after the alleged violations because it was done for law enforcement purposes, to ensure the timely prosecution of any trespass  that could be demonstrated, as Ms. Wiggin testified (T: 214 - 215.) DEC was not obliged to conduct the survey prior to Mr. Smith's logging,  since Mr. Smith had the responsibility to ensure that the logging  was restricted to his own property. For that reason, the timing of DEC's survey does not present an affirmative defense to its charges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Third Affirmative Defense - No Stated Cause of Action</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Smith claims that the causes of action alleged in the complaint fail to state a cause of action against him upon which relief can be granted. The basis for this claim was not explained in the answer, nor was counsel for Mr. Smith able to explain it at the hearing. In fact, the complaint includes three causes of action under law and regulations enforced by DEC, for which penalties are authorized by ECL 71-0703. Even if this were not the case, failure to state a cause of action is properly<page number="47" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> raised in a motion to dismiss the compliant, not as an affirmative defense. In any event, the claim is rendered academic by the proof in this case.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Fourth Affirmative Defense - Statute of Limitations</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Smith says that the claims against him are barred by the applicable statute of limitations, without specifying the statute that applies. Statute of limitations periods, as provided for under the Civil Practice Law and Rules ("CPLR"), do not apply to administrative enforcement proceedings, as noted by me at the hearing (transcript, pages 429 - 431) and by DEC Staff  in its post-hearing  brief. [See discussion of statutes of limitations in Matter of Cobleskill Stone Products, Inc. , Ruling of the Chief Administrative Law Judge, January 18, 2012.]</p><p>DEC's administrative hearings are governed by the requirement in State Administrative Procedure Act ("SAPA") 301(1) that all parties be afforded an opportunity for hearing within a reasonable time. At the hearing, counsel for Mr. Smith pointed out that four years passed between the alleged violations (in or about November 2008) and the service of the complaint (on November 16, 2012). However, he did not cite any particular prejudice this<page number="48" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> had caused to Mr. Smith's ability to defend against the charges, such that dismissal of the charges would be warranted. [See Matter of Manor Maintenance Corp. , Order of the Commissioner, February 12, 1996, in which charges were dismissed because DEC Staff's  delay in bringing them had substantially prejudiced the respondents.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Fifth and Sixth Affirmative Defenses - - Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Smith asserts that DEC's claims against him are barred by the doctrines of res judicata, which prevents the re-litigation of a cause of action, and collateral estoppel, which prevents the re-litigation of a particular issue.</p><p>In his closing brief, Mr. Smith says that, in July 2009, DEC filed criminal charges against him for the same events as are charged in this administrative proceeding. He says that he was originally charged with third-degree grand larceny, in violation of Section 155.35 of the Penal Law, that this charge was subsequently reduced to petit larceny by the Franklin County District Attorney's Office, and that the charge was ultimately dismissed with prejudice by the Hon. James R. Casitore, Jr., Malone Town Justice, on July 25, 2011.</p><p>Justice Casitore's order, <page number="49" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> received as Exhibit No. 14, indicates that the dismissal was based on a motion by Mr. Smith pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law ("CPL") Section 30.30, which addresses the right to a speedy trial. Because the dismissal was not on the merits, there having been no litigation of the underlying charge, it cannot possibly support claims of res judicata or collateral estoppel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Civil Penalty  Considerations</emphasis></p><p>As noted above, DEC Staff's  total requested penalty for the violations alleged in its complaint is $ 81,435.</p><p>For the cutting  and removal  of trees on State forest land, in violation of ECL 9-0303(1), DEC seeks a penalty of $ 77,000 pursuant to ECL 71-0703(6)(a). That provision states that in addition to any other penalty provided by law, any person who violates ECL 9-0303(1) "shall be liable to a civil penalty  of two hundred fifty dollars per tree or treble damages,  based on the stumpage  value of the tree or both."</p><p>According to the complaint, Mr. Smith was responsible for the removal  of 308 trees, a number Staff  derived from its tally  of cut stumps  that was brought into the record as Exhibit No. 8 through the testimony of DEC forester Sean Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds entered the site<page number="50" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> on May 18, 2009, with a team including other foresters, and with Mr. Gliddi, who led them to the area of the alleged trespass.  The tally  incorporates data concerning the species of each tree and its stump  diameter, which was used to calculate the value of the timber  that was removed from the affected area. (Transcript, pages 228 - 239.)</p><p>For civil penalty  assessment purposes, DEC Staff  is seeking $ 250 for each of the 308 trees alleged to have been cut and removed (i.e., $ 77,000), as well as an additional penalty equivalent to treble damages  of $ 4,335 (based on a total stumpage  value of $ 1,445 for the timber  that was taken). The $ 1,445 figure was the subject of a stipulation between the parties at the start of the hearing (transcript, pages 7 and 8), and is derived from a report of Mr. Smith's forester, Herbert Boyce, as the stumpage  value of trees removed from the 1.87 acre area: 284 cut by mechanized harvester  and another 10 cut by chain saw.  ( See pages 1 and 3 of Boyce report, received as Exhibit No. 10.)</p><p>In addition, DEC Staff  is seeking a separate civil penalty  of $ 100, for the operation of motorized vehicles and equipment on State lands, in violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(m). <page number="51" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> That extra amount is derived from ECL 71-0703(1), which allows for a civil penalty  of not less than $ 10 nor more than $ 100 for violation of a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to ECL Article 9.</p><p>To calculate an appropriate total civil penalty  in this case, DEC Staff  properly relies on the Commissioner's Civil Penalty  Policy ("CPP"), as issued on June 20, 1990. That policy states that the starting point of any penalty calculation should be a computation of the potential statutory maximum for all provable violations. (CPP Section IV.B.) Following that, an appropriate penalty is derived from a number of considerations, including the economic benefit of non-compliance, the gravity of the violations, and the culpability of the respondent's conduct.</p><p>In this case, DEC Staff  contends that the statutory maximum penalty for all the violations charged in its complaint is $ 81,535, which is $ 100 more than the total penalty Staff  is actually seeking. The difference is accounted for by Staff's  voluntary withdrawal of its request for a $ 100 penalty for its second cause of action, which addresses the destruction of trees growing on State land, in violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(g). (Transcript, <page number="52" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> pages 9 and 10.)</p><p>During the hearing, I questioned Staff  counsel whether the second cause of action (for violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(g)) was multiplicative of the first cause of action (for violation of ECL 9-0303(1)). Staff  counsel agreed with me that neither cause of action requires proof of a fact separate from the other. ( See discussion at transcript pages 283 - 286.) For that reason, I find that separate penalties for both causes of action are not warranted, and, since DEC Staff  is seeking a larger penalty for the first cause of action, a separate, though smaller, penalty for the second one as well would not be appropriate even if the request for such had been maintained.</p><p>In other words, I find that the total penalty proposed by DEC Staff  is the statutory maximum allowable in this case, given the facts it has alleged. On the other hand, I also find that such penalty is not warranted on the facts that were actually demonstrated at the hearing. That is because while DEC Staff  alleges, on the basis of its stump  tally,  that 308 trees were cut and removed during the logging operation  that occurred in or about November 2008, a more conservative and more reliable number is 284, the<page number="53" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> one proposed by Mr. Boyce.</p><p>Both Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Boyce said that they conducted their stump  tallies  in the area of the alleged timber  trespass.  However, Mr. Reynolds said DEC Staff's  tally  did not make any distinctions between trees that may have been cut by a feller buncher as compared to trees that may have been cut by a chain saw.  (Transcript, page 268.) Mr. Reynolds acknowledged seeing in the trespass  area a bunch of rotting stumps  representative of an old chain saw  cut that had occurred a long time ago, but said he did not include those stumps  in his tally.  (Transcript, pages 267 and 268.)</p><p>On the other hand, Mr. Boyce indicated there were three sets of stumps  that were cut at different times: old stumps  that appeared to have been cut by a chain saw  prior to Mr. Smith's purchase of his property in 2004, which he did not count; stumps  cut more recently by a chain saw,  which he did count; and stumps  cut most recently, in November and December 2008, by a mechanical harvester  with a circular saw head, which he also counted. (Exhibit No. 10, page one; transcript, pages 115 - 117 and 132 - 135.)</p><p>Mr. Reynolds explained the difference between cuttings  by a chain saw  and a mechanized<page number="54" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> feller, noting that "a mechanized feller cuts a tree in one motion," while "a person felling a tree with a chain saw  makes a notch, and then they back-cut to directionally fell a tree. And once the tree falls and comes off the stump  there's what we call a hinge that's left that the tree turns on. So, something cut with a mechanized harvester,  it's one smooth, sheer cut across the stump. " (Transcript, pages 268 and 269.)</p><p>All the evidence indicates that a mechanized harvester  (or feller buncher) was involved in the logging operation  undertaken in or about November 2008. There is no evidence that a chain saw  was involved, and Mr. Boyce said that the stumps  cut by a chain saw  that he counted during his tally  were cut prior to 2008. (Transcript, pages 116 and 117.)</p><p>For these reasons, I recommend that, for penalty assessment purposes, the Commissioner adopt Mr. Boyce's tally  of 284 trees cut with a mechanical harvester  during November and December 2008. Based on Mr. Boyce's testimony, the possibility exists that, since 2004, other trees were cut by chain saw  in the alleged trespass  area. However, there is no indication that this cutting  was contemporaneous with the trespass  charged <page number="55" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> in the complaint.</p><p>Mr. Boyce's tally  of 284 trees cut with a mechanical harvester  represents a more conservative and more reliable estimate of the number of trees lost during the 2008 timber  trespass,  as compared to DEC Staff's  tally  of 308. Because the cutting  straddled the property line  for a considerable distance, and because that line was not marked on the ground, I do not expect that the parties' tallies  should be identical. Nevertheless, the tallies  are relatively close to each other, and Mr. Boyce may have benefited to the extent he employed DEC's survey map,  on which the line is drawn, during his work. Mr. Boyce testified he believed he had a copy of the map  with him in the field (transcript, page 114), whereas Mr. Reynolds acknowledged twice that he and his team did not have the map  (transcript, pages 260 and 279). Mr. Reynolds said he and his team were led up the property line  by Mr. Gliddi (transcript, pages 231 and 279), apparently relying on his understanding of where the line was.</p><p>Should the Commissioner accept the tally  of 284 trees, he should also accept Mr. Boyce's calculated stumpage  value of those trees of $ 1,221.99, since the stumpage  value of $ 1,445, to which<page number="56" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> the parties stipulated, includes the value estimated by Mr. Boyce of trees cut by mechanical harvester  as well as his estimated value of trees cut by chain saw. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Maximum Penalty Warranted</emphasis></p><p>The penalties sought for the cutting  and removal  of trees in this matter are sought by DEC Staff  pursuant to ECL 71-0703(6)(a), which provides that any person who violates ECL 9-0303 "shall be liable to a civil penalty  of two hundred fifty dollars per tree or treble damages,  based on the stumpage  value of such tree or both." In this case, DEC Staff  is seeking both $ 250 per tree and treble damages,  and I conclude that this is warranted under the circumstances presented, and consistent with the Commissioner's penalty policy.</p><p>The penalty policy states that, to be a deterrent, a penalty must include a gravity component, which reflects the seriousness of the violation. That component addresses two factors: the potential harm and actual damage caused by the violation, and the relative importance of the type of violation in the regulatory scheme. (CPP Section IV.D.1.)</p><p>The first of these factors focuses on whether and to what extent the respondent's violations resulted or in could potentially result<page number="57" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> in loss or harm to the environment or human health. (CPP Section IV.D.2.a.) In this case, the trees' removal  caused actual environmental harm, including tire rutting from the operation of heavy equipment, and other disturbance from the trees being pulled or dragged across the ground surface. On May 18, 2009, DEC investigator Ken Bruno took photographs (included as part of Exhibit No. 13) which show tree stumps  and skidder trails on State land in the aftermath of the logging operation. </p><p>The second factor focuses on the importance of the violated requirement in achieving the goal of the underlying statute. (CPP Section IV.D.2.b.) Here, preventing the cutting  and removal  of trees from State lands, in the absence of legal right or permission, is directly related, and vitally important, to the stated goal of ECL 9-0303, which is the protection of those lands and the benefits they provide.</p><p>According to DEC's penalty policy, the gravity portion of a civil penalty  may be adjusted upon a consideration of factors such as culpability, violator cooperation, history of non-compliance, and ability to pay. (CPP Section IV.E.) Culpability, the policy states, will only be considered in order to<page number="58" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> increase a penalty; where the violation is intentional, reckless or (in some situations) negligent, significant upward adjustment of the penalty is deemed appropriate. (CPP Section IV.E.1.)</p><p>In this case, DEC Staff  argues that Mr. Smith was basically indifferent to his boundary with the State's property, and that this precipitated the timber  trespass  that occurred. I agree with this assessment, and find that the violation resulted from recklessness on Mr. Smith's part.</p><p>According to the penalty policy, in assessing the degree of intent, recklessness or negligence, one should consider both how much control the violator had over the events constituting the violation, and the foreseeability of the events constituting the violation. (CPP Section IV.E.1.)</p><p>As DEC Staff  argues in its post-hearing  brief, Mr. Smith had complete control over the cutting  of trees on State land. Just prior to the violation, he gave permission for the logging  on his own property, walked that property with the loggers,  and established the orange  line to which he told the loggers  to cut. This line was south of the one previously flagged by Mr. Gliddi, and was established in the absence of a survey, which should<page number="59" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> have been performed to ensure against a timber  trespass. </p><p>The importance of a survey to confirm the southern boundary  was emphasized by DEC's surveyor  witness, Ms. Wiggin, as well as by Mr. Smith's surveyor  witness, Mr. Lashway. In fact, Mr. Gliddi said that in 2005, four years before the timber  trespass,  Mr. Smith said he was going to have a survey done, though he never followed through on this.</p><p>In his written statement, Mr. Smith implied that his orange  line was consistent with that previously flagged in pink  by Mr. Gliddi. However, that was not consistent with Mr. Gliddi's testimony, or with the account given to Mr. Gliddi by Mr. Joy, who said that Mr. Smith had indicated to him that Gliddi's pink  flagging  was incorrect and that the logging  company should harvest up to the orange  line instead.</p><p>When he did his flagging,  Mr. Gliddi told Mr. Smith that the pink  line was only a rough estimate of the boundary line,  and that it was Smith's responsibility to know the line's exact location. By directing his operation into the area south of the pink  line, Mr. Smith could reasonably anticipate the resulting harm to the State forest, even if, as he maintains, he did not intend any trespass <page number="60" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> to occur.</p><p>According to the penalty policy, the cooperation of the violator in remedying a violation may be an appropriate factor to consider in adjusting a civil penalty.  (CPP Section IV.E.2.) In its post-hearing  brief, DEC Staff  points out there was no evidence that Mr. Smith cooperated with Staff  in any way; however, there is also no evidence that DEC Staff  sought remedial action from Mr. Smith. On the topic of violator cooperation, DEC Staff  argues that Mr. Smith showed contempt for the hearing by interrupting Ms. Wiggin's testimony with profanity. In fact, this did happen at one point, though I consider what was said a spontaneous utterance that, while inappropriate, does not warrant a penalty adjustment.</p><p>A history of violations subsequent to environmental enforcement actions is usually evidence that the violator has not been deterred by the previous enforcement response, meaning that, in the usual case, penalties on subsequent enforcement actions should be more severe. (CPP Section IV.E.3.) In his post-hearing  brief, Mr. Smith highlights his testimony that he has been in the logging  business all his life, as the owner of Smith's Logging  since 1977, and has never before been<page number="61" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> charged with a violation of the ECL with respect to his logging  activities. (Transcript, pages 338 and 339.) Also, he testified that he had never been sued civilly for a timber  trespass,  either. (Transcript, page 423.)</p><p>Mr. Smith's assertions were not challenged by DEC Staff;  in fact, Mr. Gliddi said DEC chose not to take action against Mr. Smith for an earlier timber  trespass  elsewhere along the same boundary, because Mr. Smith had merely cut up to a painted  yellow line, posted with State forest signs, which DEC itself had indicated the boundary was. Shortly after that trespass,  in 2005, Mr. Gliddi told Mr. Smith he had a "problem" with that line and that Mr. Smith had cut onto State land, at which point Mr. Smith said no further logging  was going to occur in that area and that he was going to have his property surveyed.  (Gliddi: transcript, page 58; Exhibit No. 1, paragraph 3.)</p><p>Finally, in some circumstances, DEC may consider the ability of a violator to pay a penalty in arriving at the method or structure for payment of final penalties. (CPP Section IV.E.4.) Mr. Smith did not assert or attempt to prove an inability to pay the penalty requested by DEC Staff,  and DEC Staff  argues<page number="62" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> that Mr. Smith is apparently a man of substantial means, pointing to his testimony that, on his own rather than with others, he owns approximately 5,000 acres of land in Clinton, Essex and Franklin counties. (Transcript, page 343.)</p><p>In his post-hearing  brief, Mr. Smith argues that the maximum amount of the civil penalty  that can be imposed in this matter is the stumpage  value of trees in the alleged trespass  area. This claim is premised on language in ECL 71-0703(6)(a) that, where a defendant establishes "by clear and convincing evidence, that when such defendant committed the violation, he or she had cause to believe that the land was his or her own," damages shall be awarded "on the basis of the stumpage  value of such tree or trees in the market as if they were privately owned."</p><p>According to his post-hearing  brief, Mr. Smith believed at the time of the alleged violation - and still believes - that the land upon which the alleged trespass  occurred was his own land. However, that is not the same as having "cause" to believe that this was so.</p><p>There was testimony from Mr. Smith that he had noticed the remnants of a barbed wire fence  when walking his property, and that he believed<page number="63" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> that the fence  delineated his southern property line.  (Transcript, page 357.) Also, it appears from DEC's maps  that the logging  stopped at or near the fence  line, which suggests that the loggers  operated from the same understanding.</p><p>Mr. Lashway said that, at least at one time prior to the State acquiring its land, the property line  may actually have been that created by the barbed wire fence,  which later became buried in the duff. However, there is no evidence that Mr. Smith consulted with Mr. Lashway prior to the 2008 timber  trespass.  Instead, it appears Mr. Lashway became involved only afterward, in which case Mr. Smith could not have relied on Lashway's judgment at the time the violation occurred.</p><p>In his post-hearing  brief, Mr. Smith highlights witness testimony about the barbed wire fence  and various colored ribbons, flagging,  paint, blazes, and State property signs found along his southern property line,  to suggest that there was confusion about the line's exact location in 2008. Photographs of these features, taken by Mr. Smith on September 11, 2009, are included as part of Exhibit No. 13.</p><p>These features are also displayed on DEC's survey maps,  and Ms. Wiggin, who created<page number="64" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> those maps,  acknowledged that, because the indicators were somewhat inconsistent, they would have generated "a lot of confusion" (T: 200). On the other hand, she added that, because of this confusion, Mr. Smith was especially responsible to know and mark his boundary before cutting  against the State. (T: 217 - 218.)</p><p>This same point was made by DEC when it recommended approval of legislation, enacted in 2003, which raised the penalties for timber  trespass  to those now available. According to DEC's memorandum, included in the bill jacket:</p><p>"Forested land in New York State is often property owned by absentee landowners, boundaries are often poorly marked, and commonly forested property is seldom surveyed.  Consequently, loggers  often cross boundary lines and harvest timber  that belongs to other property owners. This legislation seeks to cure this problem by increasing the penalties for taking the timber  of another, thereby increasing the cost to loggers  who do not ascertain the boundaries in which they harvest or choose to ignore such boundaries. Current penalties are not high enough to deter the illegal taking of timber  from state or private lands. This legislation, by increasing <page number="65" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> the penalties to allow for treble the stumpage  value, will provide for greater deterrence for the knowing offender while at the same time promote more diligence and care on the part of legitimate timber  harvesters  to prevent inadvertent trespass  or timber  theft." (Memorandum of Thomas J. O'Connor, DEC assistant commissioner, dated September 24, 2003, Bill Jacket, L 2003, ch 602, at pages 13 and 14.)</p><p>Under cross-examination, Mr. Smith said that despite the confusion about his southern property boundary, it never occurred to him at some time to hire a surveyor.  (Transcript, page 415.) While he sought and received some help from Mr. Gliddi instead, the reliable evidence indicates that, at the time of the 2008 logging operation,  he directed the loggers  to ignore the line Mr. Gliddi had previously marked for him, and directed them to a line farther south that he had marked for himself, which caused the timber  trespass. </p><p>In summary, the maximum allowable civil penalty  is warranted for the cutting  and removal  of trees from the State land, due to the seriousness of the violation, and the recklessness of Mr. Smith. Such penalty is warranted due to the gravity of the violation, to meet the<page number="66" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> penalty policy's goal of deterrence in both the general and specific sense. As the policy states:</p><p>"Penalties should persuade the violator to take precautions against falling into non-compliance again, as well as persuade others not to violate the law. Successful deterrence provides the best protection for the environment. In addition, it reduces resources necessary to enforce the laws by discouraging non-compliance." (CPP Section III, Objectives in Assessing Penalties.)</p><p>According to DEC's policy, penalties must include not only a gravity component, but a separate component intended to remove any economic benefit that results from a failure to comply with the law. (CPP Section III.) In this case, DEC Staff  estimates that benefit as being the stumpage  value of the trees that were cut and removed. In his written statement, Mr. Smith said the logs went to Tupper Lake Hardwoods and a lot of the firewood was sold locally. In his testimony, Mr. Smith said he got no money from Mr. Butts, and received "nothing but a few cords of firewood" from the logging operation,  as to which he said there was no written agreement. (Transcript, page 355.) Mr. Smith added that Mr. Butts cut very little<page number="67" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> valuable wood, and that most of what he cut was "low grade timber,  pulp, and firewood." (Transcript, page 356.)</p><p>Because DEC Staff  offered no evidence as to the economic benefit that accrued to Mr. Smith, my penalty recommendation is based entirely on the gravity component described in the Commissioner's policy. For the violation of ECL 9-0303(1), Mr. Smith should be liable not only for a civil penalty  of $ 250 per tree, but treble damages  based on the stumpage  value of the 284 trees that were cut by mechanical harvester.  The damages reflect the loss to the State from the market value of the trees, regardless of what Mr. Smith received for them.</p><p>As noted in DEC Staff's  closing brief, Matter of Roger Bresee d/b/a Bresee Tree &amp; Forestry Management (Commissioner's Decision and Order, September 11, 2006) provides precedent for the assessment of treble damages  for violation of ECL 9-0303(1), pursuant to ECL 71-0703(6)(a). In Bresee , DEC did not demand the additional penalty of $ 250 per tree. However, as DEC Staff  points out, Bresee is distinguishable because, in that matter, the respondent had an agreement with DEC, pursuant to ECL 9-0505, to cut trees on State land, and the violation<page number="68" pageScheme="2015 N.Y. ENV LEXIS 28"/> stemmed from the failure to replant the stand, in violation of that agreement. Needless to say, Mr. Smith had no such agreement; to the contrary, Mr. Gliddi had cautioned him against cutting  in the State forest.</p><p>Separate from the penalty for the cutting  and removal  of trees, DEC Staff  seeks an additional $ 100 for the use of motorized vehicles and equipment on State land, which facilitated the logging operation.  The unpermitted use of motor vehicles in the state forest, in violation of 6 NYCRR 190.8(m), is an activity for which Mr. Smith is liable for a penalty of not less than $ 10 nor more than $ 100, pursuant to ECL 71-0703(1). The maximum penalty for this violation is warranted, given the tire rutting observed by Mr. Reynolds.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Conclusions</emphasis></p><p>On or about November 2008, James R.
