The specific allegations of the citation, as amended, were (1) that Inland failed to equip its railcars  with handbrakes  and (2) that it did not have an adequate safety program for reporting  and removing from service railcars  with defective safety equipment and for preventing employees from working with those cars.</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>It was undisputed<page number="3" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> that Inland did not install handbrakes  on its railcars.  Rather, Inland contended that handbrakes  were less effective and more dangerous than wheel   blocks.  For this reason, Inland actually removed handbrakes  from its railcars  and instead used specially designed wheel   blocks  to hold railcars  in position. Inland also contended that its rules for identification and removal of defective railcars  were adequate and were communicated to its employees.</p><p>Commission Judge Richard DeBenedetto vacated both charges. He found that given the limitations and hazards  of handbrakes  in Inland's operations, Inland's decision to prevent "inadvertent  movement of railroad  cars" by using blocks  was proper. The judge also found that Inland's safety rules for reporting  and removing from service defective railcars  were adequate and that they were properly communicated to employees. Finally, Judge DeBenedetto found that the evidence did not sustain the Secretary's allegation that Inland failed to adequately enforce the rules. We affirm Judge DeBenedetto's action in vacating the amended citation.</p><p>I. <emphasis typeStyle="un">The Handbrake  Allegation</emphasis></p><p>A</p><p>Inland's Harbor Works in East Chicago, Indiana, is the largest steel  manufacturing<page number="4" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> facility in North America, comprising 2500 acres and employing 24,000 people. Inland uses some 3000 railcars  of different types in its internal railroad  operations, which include 150 to 175 miles of railway track.  Its cars move the materials used in its steelworks, including molten metal,   steel  ingots, and raw materials like scrap metal.  In addition, hundreds of "foreign" railcars  (originating from outside railroads)  are handled within the facility each day.</p><p>It is the safety of Inland's 250 or so switchmen  that is the focus of this case. Switchmen  couple railcars  to trains  and uncouple them, and perform the switching  which allows cars to transfer from one track  to another. Inland's switching  crews consist of three persons -- a "conductor," who is the head switchman,  another switchman,  also called the "helper," and a locomotive engineer.</p><p>Inland's operations consist basically of flat switching,  that is, switching   railcars  on level tracks.  Inland's yards  are "dish-shaped," that is, level except for an incline at their sides. Inland typically sorts its railcars  into their appropriate track  by releasing or "kicking" them down the inclined edge of the yard,  letting them roll freely over<page number="5" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/>  switching  points until they come to a standstill at their appropriate track.  Most of its cars are in more or less constant use, being loaded or unloaded, with intermediate switching. </p><p>Unlike foreign railcars,  Inland's railcars  do not have handbrakes.  In 1958, Inland implemented a system to prevent movement of stationary railcars  in areas where employees are working by using wood blocks  shaped like parallelograms, 2" high, 2" thick, and 11" long (measured diagonally). Inland instructs employees in the use of different types of blocking  for different circumstances, to preclude movement of the cars after blocks  are set. Each year, Inland's employees block  over 100,000 cars.</p><p>The amended citation alleged a willful section 5(a)(1) violation in that:</p><p>The employer did not provide hand brakes  on employer owned railroad  cars used in the railroad   yards  plant wide as set forth below:</p><p>Employees were exposed to the hazard  of being struck by, caught between, or run over by moving railroad  cars while conducting switching  and transporting operations as the railroad  cars were without adequate means to be braked. . . .</p><p>B</p><p>The judge found no evidence that other employers in Inland's industry, <page number="6" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> the steel  industry, "use handbrakes  instead of blocks  to secure plant railway freight cars." He also found that in the industry of interstate   railroad   carriers  "serious risks attending the use of handbrakes  persist." Specifically, employees climbing on and off railcars  to set and release handbrakes  must contend with a "precarious situation . . . . Railroad  accident data reveal that getting on and off cars and operating handbrakes  are major causes of injury . . . . [T]he Secretary has failed to show by any competent evidence that the use of blocks  has been the cause of injury to Inland employees." The judge determined that wooden blocks  were not shown to be unacceptable in either the steel  industry or among interstate   railroads  for the uses to which Inland puts them. He also determined that an "elaborate inspection and maintenance program" would be required for handbrakes  on Inland's 1400 or so gondolas -- about half its fleet -- due to the extensive damage to which they would be subjected in Inland's scrap handling operations. He found that the total repair  problems might very well be an insurmountable task and that the "record fully justifies Inland's decision" to use specially<page number="7" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> designed blocks  instead of handbrakes.  We agree.</p><p>C.</p><p>To prove that an employer violated section 5(a)(1), the Secretary must show that the employer failed to free its workplace of a hazard  that is recognized as such by the employer or generally by the employer's industry, that is causing or is likely to cause death or serious physical harm, and that could have been materially reduced or eliminated by a feasible means of abatement. <emphasis typeStyle="un">E.g.,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle="un">Cerro Metal  Products Division, Marmon Group, Inc.,</emphasis> 86 OSAHRC    /   , <citation type="case" normalizedCite="12 OSHC (BNA) 1821,at 1822"><content><span normalizedCite="12 O.S.H.

Here, Inland had instituted a program for the use of wheel   blocks,  the purpose of which was to prevent undesired or unintended movement, or movement beyond that necessary for the conduct of its usual operations. However, while we conclude that "inadvertent"  is an appropriate term to characterize the type of railcar  movement from which Inland sought to protect its employees, we need not decide whether the recognized hazard  may be defined in this manner or must be defined more narrowly as Inland contends. In a case such as this, where the employer has a mechanism designed to eliminate a hazardous condition, the burden is on the Secretary to establish that the employer's measures were inadequate. <citation type="case" normalizedCite="12 OSHC (BNA) 1821,at 1822"><content>Cerro Metal Products, supra, <span normalizedCite="12 O.S.H.

Despite this, the Secretary argues that the interstate   railroad  industry is a relevant industry, that it recognizes the need for handbrakes  in operations comparable to Inland's, and that Inland is responsible under section 5(a)(1) for following the same practices. We disagree. First, the Secretary did not prove that interstate   common carriers  generally use handbrakes  in their flat switching  operations. Second, those operations are not comparable to Inland's. Inland's switching  differs markedly because it is much more frequent, increasing greatly the serious risks of handbrake  operation, and because handbrakes  would be subject to much greater damage than in switching  operations of interstate   common carriers.  In addition, Inland regularly uses types of railcars,  such as ingot buggies, double pot cars and pan cars, that are found rarely if ever among interstate   carriers.  As described below, these cars will not accept a standard handbrake  and carry extremely hot or molten metal,  creating special problems for<page number="13" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/>  switchmen  attempting to secure them from movement.</p><p>The Secretary relies on the fact that railcars  used in interstate  commerce must be equipped with efficient handbrakes  under the Safety Appliance Act, <citation type="statute" normalizedCite="45 USC 11"><content><span normalizedCite="45 U.S.C. 11">45 U.S.C. § 11<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#1828#123#000045#         11#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>. However, there is no explicit statutory requirement that interstate   common carriers   <emphasis typeStyle="un">use</emphasis>  handbrakes  either generally or in switching  operations similar to those involved in this case.</p><p>In attempting to prove that interstate  railroads  <emphasis typeStyle="un">use</emphasis> handbrakes,  the Secretary relies on the testimony of Marshall Sage, a rail safety specialist with the United Transportation Union, and Wilder Barnes, a former Federal Railroad  Administration safety specialist. They testified that the safety rules of interstate  carriers  generally require that all railcars  be properly secured with handbrakes  when left on any track.  However, many of the railroads'  rules merely specify that a "sufficient" number of brakes  be applied to prevent cars from moving. Sage admitted that the term "sufficient" is not clear and has been interpreted in the railroad  industry to mean that brakes  do not necessarily have to be used in all instances when cars are left on tracks.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote5_51_1087_15"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p> The Union argues that Inland's rules should be more specific as to when railcars  should be secured. It points to rules of various interstate   common carriers  as models. However, we find that the common carriers'  rules are not models that Inland can be expected to follow. In any event, those rules were not actually shown to give more specific guidance than the training Inland gave employees in blocking.  Most of the safety rules submitted in evidence by the Secretary contain general statements like that of the Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway Co.: "When cars are left on any track,  sufficient hand brakes  must be set to prevent cars moving. . . ." Inland's Rule 43 gives comparably specific guidance since it requires that railcars  be blocked  before employees step between them "if there is any question of the cars not being at a complete standstill." Also, Inland trains  its switchmen  in the different types of blocking  and when to use them, and instructs employees to block  cars so that there will be no movement after they are set.</p></bodyText></footnote> Barnes also<page number="14" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> admitted that blocks  are used in railroad  switching  operations for temporarily holding cars, and Sage stated that some interstate  carriers'  rules recognize that brakes  may not always be adequate to prevent movement and require blocks  to be used in such instances. Holland, a former Inland employee who had prior rail carrier  experience, stated that he had never used handbrakes  except to hold cars on elevated tracks. </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p><page number="15" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>James Martin, Senior Vice President for Operations of the Illinois Central Gulf Railway Co. ("ICG R.Co."), testified for Inland that he did not interpret the common carriers'  rules to require the use of handbrakes  in all cases, but merely to require that cars be secured by any sufficient means. This could mean chocks or blocks,  skates, handbrakes,  or nothing at all, depending on conditions. Furthermore, Martin testified without rebuttal that in most flat switching  operations handbrakes  are not used even by interstate   carriers.  Thus, the Secretary failed to show that handbrakes  are generally used in the type of switching  operations at issue here.</p><p>Even if interstate  rail carriers  normally do use handbrakes  in their flat switching  operations, there are significant differences between the typical flat switching  operations of interstate   common carriers  and those at Inland. The most important difference is the frequency of Inland's switching.  Martin testified that Inland switches its railcars  much more often than interstate   railroads  because they are being loaded and unloaded in materials-handling almost<page number="16" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> constantly. Harding testified that Inland switches a railcar  perhaps as much as 15 to 20 times more often than outside railroads  he has observed. Thus, if handbrakes  were generally required, switchmen  would have to climb on railcars  to set or release them perhaps 15 to 20 times more often than on interstate   common carriers. </p><p>As a result of the greater frequency of Inland's switching,  the risk of injury to Inland's switchmen  while applying handbrakes  would be even greater than the risk that switchmen  for interstate  common carriers  face. On interstate  rail carriers  during 1975-78, approximately 6.5 percent of all injuries to yard-men (in which category switchmen  would fall) involved operating handbrakes.  Even if injuries on moving railcars  are excluded, the Federal Railroad  Administration Accident/Incident Bulletin covering 1978, introduced in evidence, indicates as many as 125 injuries to employees while operating handbrakes  in switching  and terminal operations, and as many as 326 other injuries while getting on or off railcars  in those operations. <footnote><anchor id="fnote6_57_1305_24"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p> The specific safety problems of setting and releasing handbrakes  were explained by Martin. Typically, applying or releasing handbrakes  requires the switchman  to climb partway up a metal  ladder on the side of the car, then step to a similar adjacent ladder on the end of the car and climb up that ladder to a narrow metal  platform (perhaps 12" wide and 20"-30" long) to operate the handbrake.  The switchman  then sets or releases the handbrake,  typically by turning a brake   wheel  or rotating a pump handle and retraces his steps down the ladder to detrain.</p><p>Martin noted that the hazards  of slippery stirrups and other surfaces would be increased in adverse weather conditions, or where there was grease on the stirrups. Martin also noted that brakes  can malfunction due to chains breaking or other factors and that a railcar  can move inadvertently -- even run away from a train  to which it was attached -- while handbrakes  are being applied or released, creating dangers to an employee attempting to leave the train  by a ladder from the handbrake  platform.</p><p>Photographs appearing in the safety manual of the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway Company, an interstate   carrier,  clearly support the judge's conclusion that switchmen  face a "precarious situation" when operating handbrakes. </p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p><page number="17" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>On the other hand, despite the large number of blocking  operations performed each year, Inland's present blocking  system had resulted in no injuries to employees due to blocking   railcars  or being struck by railcars  that had been blocked  during the entire 22 years the system had been in operation. As Martin explained, blocks  can be placed from the ground at all times, with the employee's body clear of the car. Martin testified, "most accident prevention people would, I'm sure, opt to keep the man off the car because of the potential hazard  in boarding and detraining."</p><p>Martin was well qualified to give factual opinion testimony. His duties with ICG R.Co. included responsibility for safety. Martin had served on a railroad  safety advisory committee for the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress. The committee prepared an extensive study of the causes of railroad  accidents and Federal regulation of the subject. Martin also had responsibilities for development of safe practices of Class I (major) rail carriers  as Vice President of Operations and Maintenance for the Association<page number="18" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> of American Railroads.  Martin's conclusion is also consistent with the recommendation of Inland's committee that formulated Inland's current blocking  system in 1958. None of the five switchmen  who served on that committee, most of whom were experienced in the operations of interstate  rail carriers,  advocated using handbrakes.  The other member of the committee was then transportation superintendent, Smolt, who previously had worked as a switchman.  He testified that operating handbrakes  is the most hazardous part of a switchman's  job.</p><p>The much greater damage handbrakes  would be exposed to in Inland's operations also makes any comparison between Inland and interstate   carriers  inapposite. The judge found that if handbrakes  were required on Inland's 1400 or so gondolas -- about half its fleet -- damage to the handbrakes  would be so frequent that the repair  problems "may very well be an insurmountable task." Martin noted that in Inland's scrap metal  transportation operations "there is no way to keep safety appliances in working order," due to the almost constant damage to which the gondolas are exposed from huge pieces of scrap metal  -- individual pieces weighing as much as 4 or 5 tons<page number="19" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> -- being loaded into and unloaded from the cars with electromagnets. Martin explained that different considerations apply with respect to interstate   carriers.  Although there is a limited amount of scrap handling done on interstate  rail carriers,  there is not the frequent exposure of safety appliances to heavy damage due to constant loading and unloading. Instead, interstate   carriers  use switching   yards  primarily to receive, sort out, and dispatch trains  originating from, and destined for, other points.</p><p>Inland's frequent transportation of extremely hot or molten metal  on specially designed cars is another important difference between its operations and those of interstate   common carriers.  Many of Inland's cars are regularly involved in the transport of extremely hot or molten metals.  These include 500 or so ingot buggies, 50 double pot cars, 31 or more pugh ladle cars, and an unspecified number of pan cars. Martin testified that ingot buggies, double pot cars and pan cars would not accept a standard braking system, so a special system would have to be devised for them. The extreme heat of the metals  carried on many of Inland's cars would preclude mounting the car to set handbrakes, <page number="20" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> whereas blocks  may be set because the switchman  is shielded somewhat from the heat by the car's body when setting them. Martin noted that interstate   common carriers  rarely carry hot metal. </p><p>Thus, numerous important differences in working conditions and hazards  make the Secretary's comparison between the braking practices of interstate  rail carriers  and Inland inappropriate. The interstate   railroad  industry simply does not furnish a model that Inland should be expected to follow. <emphasis typeStyle="un">See</emphasis><citation type="case" normalizedCite="645 F.2d 822,at 830"><content>Donovan v.

As noted above, Inland had great success in safely holding railcars  with blocks,  and it had no injuries attributable to its present blocking  system in the 22-year history of that system. Numerous witnesses experienced with both common carriers  and in-plant railroads  testified that Inland's blocking  system was<page number="21" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> quite adequate, even when compared to handbrakes.  Accordingly, the Secretary's argument that the use of blocks  rather than handbrakes  would increase the likelihood of railcar  movement in certain specific situations is not supported by the record.</p><p>Transportation superintendent Harding testified that properly blocked  cars will hold railcars  in almost all situations, including on icy or wet rails. Inland employees are advised of different types of blocking  to be used in different circumstances and are instructed to block  all cars so that there will be no movement after they are set. Inland also has procedures to test the sufficiency of the blocking  before the railcars  are left on any track.  Harding testified that where the incline is away from the engine, the initial blocking  should be tested before the blocked  cars are uncoupled from the train,  by backing the train  slightly to see if the blocks  hold. If they do, there is reasonable assurance that the blocking  is sufficient, and the railcars  are then uncoupled from the train.  Where the incline is toward the engine, the train  may be pulled slightly forward to test the blocks,  or the blocked  cars may be uncoupled and the engine may pull<page number="22" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> away a short distance. In the latter case, if the blocks  fail the blocked  cars will roll toward the engine and couple up again, and additional blocking  will be used. Although the process of setting blocks  sometimes involves more than one attempt, switchman   Thedford,  a former union safety steward, testified that if an initial blocking  failed, he would simply try other blocking  methods until a successful combination was found. Thus, Inland's procedures were designed to minimize the chance of railcars  rolling free after they were blocked. </p><p>Martin testified that Inland's blocking  system is "certainly very adequate" for securing railcars  in its operations, "very safe" and actually "superior to the handbrake  . . . in the type of activity they are involved in." Martin had visited Inland's facility and had observed its blocking  system in use. His opinion was also based on his observation of other intraplant railroad  facilities in the steel  industry that used blocks  rather than handbrakes,  including Bethlehem Steel  Company, Armco Steel  Corporation, and Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company.</p><p>William Webber, an Inland trainmaster, and Charles C. Shannon, an independent railroad  consultant, also<page number="23" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> testified that Inland's blocking  system was fully adequate for securing its railcars.  They also were well qualified to give such an opinion. Webber previously had been a switchman  for Inland for more than five years, and before that had been a brakeman, operating handbrakes  for the Pennsylvania Railroad  for about five years. Shannon, an independent railroad  consultant since 1960, had previously been a trainmaster qualified in and responsible for instructing switchmen  on railroad  safety rules including handbrake  use for the Chicago and Northwestern Railway and had a total of 19 years managerial experience with that railroad.  While employed by the railroad,  Shannon personally had set blocks  and applied brakes.  Like Martin, he also observed Inland's blocking  system first-hand.</p><p>The Secretary relies on evidence that blocks  could fail on Inland's pugh ladle cars (molten metal   carriers)  due to the great weight of the cars, water and mud on the tracks,  the incline of the tracks  and the swaying of the cars when the molten metal  is poured into them. However, Harding testified that pugh ladle cars generally hold during loading operations when properly blocked  on both sides of a wheel.  The only<page number="24" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> way that a properly blocked  pugh ladle could move in Harding's opinion was if molten metal  spilled and burned the blocks  or if some equipment such as a bulldozer struck the car -- both very rare occurrences, based on his testimony. Furthermore, Harding testified that in his opinion a handbrake  would not hold a loaded pugh ladle either. Webber testified that the high temperature of the hot steel  carried on ingot mold buggies and stake cars would preclude the use of handbrakes,  whereas those cars could be blocked  because temperatures are cooler near track  level.</p><p>The Secretary further argues that handbrakes  were needed because railcars  generally could be struck by machines during loading or unloading and roll free of their blocks.  While arguably further braking measures might decrease the chance of movement in that limited situation, there is no evidence that any employee had ever been endangered by such an occurrence nor any evidence from which to determine the likelihood or the frequency of such occurrences.</p><p>Barnes, a witness for the Secretary, pointed out that handbrakes  have the holding power of 11 percent of the gross car weight; that they apply equally to all eight wheels  on<page number="25" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> the typical railcar;  and that they retain some braking power even if the railcar  is set in motion, whereas blocks  have none once a wheel  rolls over them. For example, Barnes testified that a railcar  could be derailed if Inland's strongest blocking  method, crossblocking -- where two blocks  are placed at right angles so that one braces the other -- were used on one set of wheels  and the crossblocked car were struck or pushed. There is no evidence that such a derailment had ever actually occurred. Barnes was the only witness to testify to this possibility, and he was not asked to describe the likelihood of such occurrences in light of the conditions existing in Inland's facility. Barnes also testified that in his opinion Inland's blocking  procedure was hazardous because of the proximity of the employee's hand to the wheel  in setting the block  and the amount of time required in those situations where more than one block  must be set. However, Barnes had never visited Inland's facility. There is no indication that he had any knowledge of operations of internal railways in the steel  industry, nor was he familiar with the type of blocks  and the details of the blocking  system instituted by<page number="26" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> Inland. The committee which developed Inland's present blocking  system had established based on actual tests that the special, tapered design of Inland's blocks  eliminated the hazards  of employees' fingers or hands being pinched between a block  and a rail, or between a block  and a wheel,  when placed properly. The judge was not persuaded that Barnes' testimony, or that of Sage, outweighed the evidence supporting Inland's position. We cannot say that the judge erred. <footnote><anchor id="fnote7_75_1924_184"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p> OSHA's compliance officer, Gigli, also gave opinion testimony tending to show that handbrakes  should be required. However, Gigli had no personal experience with rolling railroad  stock or steel   railroads.  Thus, his opinions are entitled to no greater weight that those of Sage and Barnes. The Secretary's evidence on the need for handbrakes  did not preponderate over Inland's contrary evidence.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>The Secretary presented testimony that blocks  had been dislodged if they were "green" (insufficiently cured), or if the blocks  or rails were wet or icy. <page number="27" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> However, Transportation Department Superintendent Harding testified without contradiction that cars would not move even under those circumstances if the blocks  were properly set as employees were taught and that properly placed blocks  would hold railcars  in almost all situations. The number of such incidents of blocks  failing to hold were few and, as shown below, Inland closely supervised compliance with its blocking  procedures and disciplined employees who failed to properly block.  There is other employee testimony, on which the Secretary also relies, that at times inadvertent  movement of blocked  cars had occurred because a car had been kicked into a track  and had hit a blocked  car, causing it to roll free of its blocks.  However, many of Inland's tracks  have permanent derails and/or locking switch stands. These devices prevent cars from moving into the protected track.  Also, Harding testified that when employees are working on or near a track,  they will place portable derails on both ends of the track  or at one end if it is a stub track.  There was no evidence from which to conclude that these precautions were not adequate to protect employees from being struck by a car dislodged from<page number="28" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> its blocks  by a kicked car.</p><p>The adequacy of Inland's blocking  system is also objectively demonstrated by the relatively low incidence of block  failure compared to the total number of blocking  operations performed. Thus, Thedford  stated that he had experienced blocks  failing to hold a car only once or twice a week. Employee Warner testified that during the six months he had worked as a switchman  he had blocked  cars on numerous occasions and only in 10 instances did the blocks  fail to hold. Although the details of Inland's safety program are discussed more fully in the Part II, we note that Inland monitors compliance with its safety rules and disciplines employees for infractions. During the period from 1974 through 1979, Inland reprimanded or penalized employees on 25 occasions for failure to block  cars properly. Section 5(a)(1) does not require an employer necessarily to prevent every instance of hazardous conduct by its employees. <emphasis typeStyle="un">See</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle="un">Jones &amp; Laughlin</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle="un">Steel  Corp.,</emphasis><citation type="case" normalizedCite="82 OSAHRC 34"><content><span normalizedCite="82 O.S.H.

Leaving aside the question of whether the union may press claims that the Secretary has abandoned, we find Inland's procedures for handling moving cars to be adequate to protect its employees. We agree with the judge that the speed of the cars is adequately controlled by the locomotives, which move at a slow rate of speed, and by the basically flat topography of the dish-shaped switching  yards.  In fact, as the judge found, "[t]he evidence indicates that having switchmen  dismount the car and safeguard road crossings in the path of the 'runaway' car, as Inland does, is a safer practice in dealing with the situation than the Secretary's recommended method of requiring switchmen  to manipulate hand brakes  of a moving car."</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p><page number="30" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>In sum, none of the evidence relied on by the Secretary shows a need for Inland to use brakes  to protect employees from railcar  movement.

The employer did not maintain railroad  cars in a <emphasis typeStyle="un">safe</emphasis> operating condition. The employer's use of defective railroad  cars exposed employees to the hazard  of being struck by, run<page number="31" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> over by, caught between, or falling from such railroad  cars while switching  or transporting the cars. Railroad  cars with defective or missing  uncoupler devices (pin   lifters) , bent and crushed stirrups, bent, crushed, loose and missing  handholds (grab irons) and broken yokes (carrier  irons) were being used rather than taken out of service as set forth below: [list of individual railroad  cars omitted]</p><p>B. The employer failed to enforce company safety rules requiring transportation employees to identify and report defective railroad  cars having missing  or defective uncoupler devices (pin   lifters) , bent or crushed stirrups, bent, crushed, loose or missing  hand holds (grab irons) and broken yokes (carrier  irons).</p><p>C.

The uncoupler devices, commonly called "pin   lifters, " permit railcars  to be uncoupled without an employee stepping between the cars and facing the risk of railcar  movement. The pin   lifter  consists of a lever extending from beneath the coupling mechanism ("knuckle") at the end of the railcar  to the outer edge of the car. To uncouple two railcars,  the employee pushes down on the lever, causing the other end of the lever to rise, pushing up the "pin"  in the knuckler and unlocking the knuckle. The "stirrups" are the rungs of the metal  ladders on the sides and ends of the railcars,  and the "handholds" or "grab irons" are metal  handles that employees grasp while climbing on and off the railcars  or riding on them. The "drawbar" is the metal  shaft, one end of which forms the knuckle and the other end of which attaches to the railcar's  frame. The "yoke" attaches to the end of the railcar  and acts as a collar around the "drawbar," holding it in place.</p></bodyText></footnote><br/>(Emphasis in original)</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p><page number="32" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>It is undisputed that at times some of Inland's railcars  in service had defective pin   lifters,  stirrups or handholds; that switchmen  did not always report defective railcars;  and that at times some switchmen  went between railcars  to uncouple cars manually, due to missing  or defective pin   lifters.  It also is undisputed that Inland had an extensive safety program including rules designed to prevent these problems, communication of the rules to switchmen,  and efforts to detect violations. The basic issues in dispute are whether Inland's safety procedures for reporting  defective railcars  and uncoupling   railcars  were adequate, and whether its safety rules were adequately communicated to employees and adequately enforced.</p><p>The judge found that Inland had established an adequate safety program and that its employees were adequately trained in the pertinent safety rules. He rejected as not credible certain testimony introduced by the Secretary to show that supervisors  coerced or induced employees to violate these rules. He also found that the Secretary did not provide a sufficiently definite standard or<page number="33" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> criterion against which to judge Inland's maintenance program and that the Secretary failed to show what additional measures Inland could have taken to insure compliance with its safety rules.

Inland's Rule 4 addresses the reporting  and removal from service of defective railcars.  The term "bad order" as used in the rule means that the railcar  has a defective safety appliance or some other defect warranting removal from service. The rule states:</p><p>Conductors and switchmen  must report all defective equipment to their Yardmaster. </p><p>Inland bad order cars carded bad order by car repairmen or found bad order by switch crews, yardmasters,  etc. must be set direct to the Rip Tracks  unless the car has to be unloaded first before it can be repaired. In these cases special switches will be made to expedite the unloading and the subsequent setting of the car empty to the Rip Tracks. </p><p>Bad order foreign empty cars are to be set outbound as soon as possible. Bad order foreign loaded (inbound) cars are to be set for unloading as soon as possible and then set outbound empty immediately when released. Exception -- Foreign cars with broken drawbars are to be set aside in the plant for "I. <page number="36" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> H.B." or "J" to repair. </p><p>Red "bad order" cars signify major defects. A car with a red card must not be moved unless authorized by the Trainmaster or Asst. Superintendent and then it must be handled carefully to specific destination. <footnote><anchor id="fnote11_105_2532_211"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p> Yardmasters  are the switchmen's   supervisors  and are responsibile for the proper operation of their respective years. The trainmaster on each shift is in overall charge of rail operations throughout Inland's facility. "Rip tracks"  are repair   tracks  in the yard  where bad order cars are to be directed and taken out of service until repaired. "Foreign cars" are railcars  from outside railroads.  "I.H.B." apparently refers to the Indiana Harbor Belt Railway and the "J" apparently refers to the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway Company, which are outside railroads. </p></bodyText></footnote><br/>In addition to requiring switchmen  to report defective equipment, Inland's Transportation Department has a field repair  crew consisting of two supervisors  and about 23 car repairmen assigned to inspect, repair  and oil railcars  in the yards  daily. Yard  clerks also are supposed to locate and report all defective equipment in the course of their duties. There is no evidence that switchmen,  yardmasters,  or car repairmen could not determine when a railcar  is defective. So far as this record shows, Inland has adequate procedures for reporting  defective railcars  and removing them from service.</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p><page number="37" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>As to the problem of switchmen  working between railcars,  Inland's Rule 43 provides:</p><p>Before stepping between cars to open knuckles, adjust drawbars and etc., the cars must be at a complete standstill and a 20-foot opening between the cars. Also if there is any question of the cars not being at a complete standstill they must be blocked. </p><p>At night when it is necessary to step between cars to work on knuckles, drawbars, etc., switchman  must place his lantern on the ground where it can be seen by the other switchmen  or engineer. Engineer is not to move the cars while the lantern is on the ground.<br/>In 1977, Inland further restricted work between cars by issuing a new Rule 60 (later renumbered as Rule 58 in Inland's revised rulebook). That rule provides:</p><p>Under no circumstances will switchmen  be permitted to lift pins  by hand without using cut levers.</p><p>1. When cut lever is missing  or inoperative switchman  must cross in a safe manner to the other side of train  and pull the cut lever on the other car.</p><p>2. If cut levers are missing  or inoperative on both sides of the train  the cars must be set out<page number="38" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> as bad orders for car repair  to replace or repair  cut levers.<br/>So far as this record shows, these rules would minimize the possibility of switchmen  being injured by a moving railcar  while working with defective equipment.</p><p>B</p><p>We also find that the safety rules were properly communicated to switchmen.  Inland had an extensive safety program for switchmen  that included instructions on the safety rules. Switchmen  were given three days of classroom training and seven days of on-the-job training before starting work. Included in this training were instructions on the pertinent safety rules and on safe procedures for the specific jobs switchmen  must perform, including blocking  cars, pulling pins  and coupling cars. The latter training is based on numerous detailed job safety analyses ("JSAs") that Inland has developed for particular aspects of the switchman's  job. A test is administered to the switchmen  at the end of the 10-day course. Following the course, each switchman-trainee spends two weeks as an extra member of switch crews. Three different conductors must sign a card saying that the trainee works safely and can handle the job. During the following three months each trainee is placed<page number="39" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> on a particular job for a week at a time with an experienced conductor.</p><p>The evidence establishes that the switchmen  knew Inland's safety rules. Switchman   Thedford  testified that each day a safety rule pertaining to their jobs is read to the switchmen,  and he remembered that Rule 43 had been read occasionally. Dills, a switchman  who had reviously been a foreman, had learned the rules from instruction by yardmasters.  Warner, formerly a switchman,  had been trained in safety rules, including Rules 4, 43, and 60, and had been specifically instructed not to uncouple cars lacking pin   lifters.  Former switchman  Connelly was familiar with Rules 4 and 43, and he indicated that he had learned of the rules through safety bulletins issued and posted by Inland.</p><p>The Secretary relies on conductor Gillie's testimony that he did not know about Rule 60 until after the citations were issued and that he had not seen it posted. However, Transportation Superintendent Harding testified that safety notices -- the form in which Rule 60 was first issued -- are posted in the different yard  areas for the switchmen  to read, and are the subject of safety contacts and observations. The judge found Gillie's testimony, <page number="40" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> including that claiming ignorance of Rule 60, not to be credible.</p><p>The principles governing our determination of the correctness of a judge's credibility finding are well established. Normally, we will accept the administrative law judge's evaluation of the credibility of witnesses because it is the judge who has lived with the case, heard the witnesses and observed their demeanor. <emphasis typeStyle="un">C.

He also specifically identified much of the testimony by Gillie that he failed to credit, and stated the reasons:</p><p>Mr. Gillie's testimony is strikingly unconvincing. Time and time again he displayed bias against Inland, particularly in his demeanor and the manner in which he responded to questions on cross-examination. The major points of incredibility in his testimony include the alleged incidents of being harassed by Inland's supervisors  if he failed to undertake the dangerous practice of lifting pins  by hand . . . the alleged lack of knowledge concerning Inland's Safety Rule No. 60 which prohibits that very practice . . . the amount of defective cars alleged to be as much as 70 percent and his claimed efforts to alleviate the problem . . . . It is significant to note that although he had held the responsible jobs of "union griever" and "safety committeeman," neither Mr. Gillie nor any other conductor or switchman  has asserted his rights under Article 14, section 6, of the collective bargaining agreement concerning defective cars [permitting<page number="42" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> an employee to be relieved of work that he believes is unnecessarily hazardous]. . . . It is also noteworthy that despite his professed concern regarding defective equipment and its hazards,  Mr. Gillie failed to take any action on Inland's offer of establishing a joint union-management committee to investigate the problem of bad order cars, which was raised by Mr. Gillie himself in an October 1978 "Safety Agenda" while Mr. Gillie was acting as a safety committeeman . . . .</p><p>(citations to the record omitted)<br/>The judge's decision not to credit Gillie's testimony, including his assertion that he had not known Rule 60, is sufficiently explained on the basis of factors that are peculiarly observable by the judge: Gillie's demeanor on the witness stand and his manner of responding to questions on cross-examination. The judge perceived a bias against Inland that made Gillie's testimony unreliable. We cannot say that this well-explained finding is erroneous. We also note that Gillie's testimony on Rule 60 conflicts with Superintendent Harding's testimony that safety notices such as Rule 60 are posted for switchmen  to read. We accept and concur with both the judge's credibility finding<page number="43" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> regarding Gillie and his finding that the safety rules were adequately communicated to the employees.</p><p>C</p><p>The remaining issue is whether, despite Inland's extensive safety program, the Secretary proved that the safety rules were not properly enforced. The Secretary argues that switchmen  routinely breached the rules, that Inland knew or should have known of the employee violations, and that supervisors  participated in and actively encouraged safety rule violations.</p><p>The evidence supports the Secretary's assertion that at times some switchmen  violated the rule against standing between cars to operate defective uncoupling  devices manually. For example, Warner testified that he did so one or more times per shift, and Connelly testified that he did so three or more times per shift, even after Inland's Rule 60 was implemented in 1977. Both Thedford  and Connelly testified that the requirement in Rule 43 that switchmen  never work between railcars  that are less than 20 feet apart is sometimes violated because couplers will not connect properly when cars are brought together from that distance, particularly on curved track. </p><p>However, the mere fact that some switchmen  violated safety rules<page number="44" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> at times on Inland's vast worksite does not prove a section 5(a)(1) violation by Inland. Inland employs some 250 switchmen,  who perform innumerable switching  operations. Also, switch crew members often had to work out of each other's sight and out of sight of their supervisors,  the yardmasters,  who are in a central office or tower in each yard  and cannot observe individual switchmen  at work in most instances. For example, regarding the Corona fatality, the yardmaster's  tower in that yard  was at least 100 yards  from the site of the incident, too far to permit personal observation of Corona's activities. Nevertheless, Inland has programs for enforcing safety rules through monitoring employee performance and disciplining employees for violations. To monitor employee performance, Inland's APF (Accident Prevention Fundamentals) Program calls for safety contacts and observations. Safety contacts are either group meetings or one-on-one reviews between employees and supervisors  on safety rules or JSAs. Observations are planned visits by supervisors  to determine whether an employee actually is complying with safety rules and JSAs. Employee performance is graded, with an unsatisfactory performance<page number="45" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> indicating a need for reinstruction. If the employee is following the rules, a discussion may not be needed and may not be held. According to Lundie, Inland's safety director, the APF Program has been successful in reducing the number of accidents and injuries at Inland since it was implemented in 1965.</p><p>Also, Inland's management disciplines employees when it discovers violations of safe practices. In addition to the reprimands or discipline issued for failure to block  cars properly, previously referred to, Switchman  Gaglio was suspended for three days without pay in 1978 for violating Rule 43. Switchman  Corona was verbally reprimanded by trainmaster Webber three days before his death for violating Rule 43 and was told he would be suspended. Later, after studying Corona's personnel records and finding no previous incidents, Inland determined that a written reprimand would be issued instead. Issuance was pending when Corona died. On these facts the Secretary must show more than occasional instances of noncompliance with safety rules in Inland's yards  to establish that it violated section 5(a)(1). <emphasis typeStyle="un">See</emphasis><citation type="case" normalizedCite="10 OSHC (BNA) 1778,at 1783"><content>Jones &amp; Laughlin, supra, <span normalizedCite="10 O.S.H.

For example, Connelly testified that when uncoupling  cars having defective lifters,  he would inform the engineer and instruct the engineer not to move the engine until the uncoupling  was completed.</p><p>The Secretary argues, however, that yardmasters  knew that switchmen  violated safety rules and condoned, encouraged, and even participated in violations. The Secretary's specific arguments are that yardmasters  knew that employees did not consistently report defective cars and sometimes failed to ensure that bad order cars that were reported were removed from service as required by Rule 4, that yardmasters  also knew that switchmen  sometimes violated Rules 43 and 60, that they actually required switchmen  to violate these rules by "harassing" them if they did not do so, and that yardmasters  personally violated those rules at times.</p><p>The Secretary relies on the compliance officer's testimony that yardmaster  Westerfield told him that about 90 percent of Inland employees did not report defective cars, and that<page number="47" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> Harding also told him some employees did not report them. However, since Inland placed primary reliance for detecting and correcting defective railcars  on its field repair  crew in addition to its yard  clerks who were also responsible for reporting  defective railcars,  Inland had procedures to make sure that defective cars were removed from service even if switchmen  disobeyed the rule to report them. In any event, several switchmen  testified that they did in fact report defective cars. <footnote><anchor id="fnote12_130_3043_149"/><label>12</label><bodyText><p> The Union notes that there were no written instructions informing employees what constitutes a defective car and argues that shows inadequate communication of Inland's safety rules. We disagree because that argument over-emphasizes formal aspects of Inland's safety program at the expense of its substance. The lack of written instructions was not shown to decrease employee awareness of the defects to be reported or reduce employee compliance with reporting  procedures. <emphasis typeStyle="un">See Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel  Corp.,</emphasis><citation type="case" normalizedCite="82 OSAHRC 34"><content><span normalizedCite="82 O.S.H.

Former switchman  Connelly testified that there was a chronic failure among yardmasters  to write up orders on bad order equipment that had been reported, thus preventing the equipment from being taken out of service. However, as the judge found, the only specific incident Connelly recounted in that regard "seriously undermines the import of Mr. Connelly's statements." Connelly testified that once between 1972 and 1976, yardmaster  Lambert (since retired) asked Connelly to pick up four or five railcars  to use in mill operations. Connelly initially objected because he considered them to be "bad order." Lambert asked Connelly to reconsider because the cars were needed at the mill, and assured him that the cars would be repaired as soon as that operation was completed. Connelly agreed. In his testimony, Connelly did not specify<page number="49" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> what the defects had been. Under Rule 4, the yardmaster  must exercise judgment to determine whether a defect is serious, warranting immediate removal from service, or minor, not requiring immediate action. Thus, Connelly's account of his agreement with Lambert actually undermines his general allegations of yardmasters  failing to comply with Rule 4. Indeed, Connelly admitted that it may not always be possible to take a bad order car immediately out of service. We are not persuaded that either Warner or Connelly knew of any failure of a yardmaster  to write up appropriate orders on any car with a defective or missing  pin  lifter  or other defect warranting removal from service. <footnote><anchor id="fnote13_134_3122_53"/><label>13</label><bodyText><p> We reach the same conclusion with respect to Connelly's testimony, which the judge did not address, of another instance when a great deal of scrap loading required the use of an unusual number of cars, including bad order cars.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>Switchman   Thedford  testified that he had reported bad order cars in writing to Assistant Transportation<page number="50" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> Superintendent DuVall but admitted he could not testify that those same cars were not repaired. He also testified that on one occasion he had reported to Duvall the car numbers of 20 to 25 bad order cars, and that most of the "major" repairs  were not made, although some minor repairs  were made. However, this testimony does not establish that DuVall did not properly report those cars to car repair  and remove them from service. In fact, it suggests that he did. Thus, thedford's  testimony does not support the Secretary's position regarding the implementation of Inland's safety rules.</p><p>Yardmaster  Westerfield testified that he always wrote up switch orders on bad order cars and always reported railcars  to car repair  when he saw missing   pin   lifters,  crushed or broken handholds, bent stirrups or cracked yokes. On an average workshift he reported up to five or ten railcars  as bad order. As discussed below, the judge refused to credit other testimony that implicated yardmasters  in safety rule violations and that conflicted with Westerfield's testimony. In fact, Superintendent Harding testified that switchmen  do not even need a yardmaster's  permission to set bad order cars to the repair   tracks. <page number="51" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> We are therefore not convinced that yardmasters  interfered with the removal of bad order cars from service as alleged.</p><p>The employees' testimony must also be viewed in light of the evidence regarding the extent of bad order cars. The Secretary argues that such a high percentage of railcars  in service were defective that Inland's procedures for reporting  and removing such cars from service must have been inadequate under section 5(a)(1). However, it was not established what percentage of cars in service was defective. Former switchman  Connelly testified at one point that as much as 70 percent of Inland's cars in service were in bad order condition, but later he gave an estimate (400 bad order cars out of a total of 5000) that amounts to only about 8 percent. Gillie also testified to the 70 percent figure but the judge ruled his testimony not credible and we accept that finding for the reasons discussed above. Harding denied that Inland had found as many as one-third of cars in service to be defective.</p><p>Compliance officer Gigli testified that of the 55 cars he personally examined, approximately 60 percent were in bad order condition. He could not recall the total number of cars in<page number="52" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> the yard  during his inspection. Since he had no prior experience with railroad  rolling stock, gigli did not know the relative number of bad order cars that would normally be present in a typical railroad  yard  at any given time; his opinion that there were too many defective cars in service was based on his overall experience in an industrial environment and did not take into account the particular materials handled by Inland's cars. At the same time, however, Gigli conceded that the repair  tracks  were filled with cars waiting to be repaired. This evidence does not establish that Inland failed to take adequate steps to remove bad order cars from service, <footnote><anchor id="fnote14_140_3226_248"/><label>14</label><bodyText><p> The fact that Inland's repair   tracks  were full tends to establish that Inland's rule requiring the reporting  and removal from service of defective railcars  was adequately implemented. Conversely, however, it is equally obvious that the ultimate effectiveness of the rule depends as well on the adequacy of Inland's car repair  procedures. Nevertheless, the Secretary's citation does not directly allege any inadequacy in Inland's car repair  program itself. The record shows that in response to Gillie's request in October 1978 for an improved repair  program, Inland assigned additional personnel and a second supervisor  to the repair  shop and established two additional repair   tracks.  At the time of the inspection, Inland each month was repairing between 750 and 800 cars, almost one-third of its entire fleet. In a memorandum written to DuVall in June 1979, after the inspection, Thedford,  then union safety steward, expressed approval of car repair  efforts during one week in that month when 181 cars were repaired. In referring to this amount of car repair,  which is equivalent to a monthly repair  rate of 785 cars, Thedford  stated, "I think our [s]upervisors are doing a fine job in helping us have safe equipment to work with." Although Thedford  also concluded that a large number of bad order cars remained, his memorandum recognized rule 4 and stated that employees can assist in reducing the incidence of bad order cars by reporting  defects as required by that rule. Accordingly, Thedford  apparently considered Inland's repair  facilities to be capable of handling the number of defective cars that in his view should be reported under Rule 4.</p></bodyText></footnote> nor does it show what additional measures Inland could have implemented to protect switchmen  from having to work with defective gondolas or other cars.</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p><page number="53" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>The Secretary also relies on employee testimony that yardmasters  knowingly allowed or required switchmen  to violate Rules 43 and 60 on occasion. However, the judge refused to credit that testimony, and we accept the judge's credibility findings, for the reasons discussed below. The other testimony also fails to show supervisory knowledge of, or involvement in, safety rule violations.</p><p>First we will discuss the testimony that the judge refused to credit. Switchman  Warner testified that although he was taught the correct methods of uncoupling  cars by yardmaster  Murray, Murray had given him advice "off the record" during that training on how to "save time and trouble" when uncoupling  cars with defective pin   lifters  by pushing the pin  up with a wooden block  while standing between the cars. As the judge observed, Murray flatly denied having given any such instruction. Furthermore, Warner admitted that he would have been reprimanded for violating a safety rule if he were injured while uncoupling  cars in the manner Murray suggested. In effect, Warner was testifying that a supervisor  would give an instruction<page number="54" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> directly contrary to a safety rule known to be enforced by Inland. In our view, the judge could reasonably find such testimony not to be credible.</p><p>Thedford  testified that in early 1979 in Plant 1, yardmaster  Westerfield was present when Thedford  operated couplers manually because they were missing   pin   lifters.  He also said that Westerfield and certain other yardmasters  had manually opened "knuckles" for lack of pin   lifters  and had gone between cars that were spaced less than 20 feet apart. However, Westerfield testified that he expected employees to adhere to "serious" safety rules like Rule 43 and that disciplinary action is "almost automatic" for infractions of such rules. He testified that he had never seen, not had ever been informed of, individuals uncoupling  a car that was missing  a pin   lifter  and that he would not condone that practice. Thus, he flatly denied any implication that he was involved in safety rule violations.</p><p>The Secretary also relies on the testimony of former switchman  Holland that company officials knew of the practice of employees going between railcars  to uncouple them when pin   lifters  were missing.  However, Holland was retired and had not worked for Inland<page number="55" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> since 1975, before Inland's Rule 60 specifically prohibited that practice. Rule 43, the only pertinent safety rule when Holland was an employee, did not forbid it. Furthermore, Holland stated that at least on some occasions when it was necessary to operate a defective coupler, Inland's mobile car repair  facility would send a repairman to install a pin   lifter.  Holland's testimony does not show that Inland supervisors  condoned violations of any safety rules, either before or after he retired.</p><p>Warner, Thedford,  and Gillie made general statements that they would be subjected to "harassment" by yardmasters  if they did not go between cars and manually operate coupling devices at times to keep the trains  moving. They alleged that the "harassment" would take the form of being "chewed out" by the yardmaster,  being restricted to the official lunch period of 20 minutes, not being allowed the routine one-hour early quitting time, or being assigned the least desirable jobs. However, of the two yardmasters  who testified, Yardmaster  Westerfield stated that employee violations of safety rules are not tolerated and yardmaster  Murray Flatly stated that the employee testimony against him was not true. <page number="56" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> Murray also stated that when training employees he always explains that cars having defective pin   lifters  are to be set aside as bad order and are not to be used. Also, in a letter submitted in evidence, written about a week before the Corona fatality that led to OSHA's inspection, Superintendent Harding brought Gillie's attention to Rule 4 and added, "Switch crew members are not forced to work with B/O [bad order] equipment as stated in your letter."</p><p>The judge found that the testimony of Warner, Thedford,  and Gillie about yardmasters  actively encouraging safety rule violations "was flatly contradicted by Inland's witnesses in many material respects; and when questioned on cross examination by Inland's counsel, [Warner's, Thedford's,  and Gillie's] account of particular events created a strong impression that they were giving a wrong coloring to material facts so as to deprive them of credit." The judge also discredited Gillie's testimony generally, as discussed above. Like the Secretary, we are troubled by an implication in the judge's decision that the employees' claims of harassment are not credible because their testimony showed only that they broke work rules to gain from<page number="57" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> supervisors  longer lunch periods and earlier quitting time. Such actions by supervisors  would tend to undermine the company's safety program. However, all the credibility findings concerning Warner, Thedford,  and Gillie are adequately explained on the basis of matters peculiarly observable by the judge -- the witnesses' demeanor on the stand and their manner of responding on cross-examination. The judge's findings also rest on the contrary testimony of Inland's witnesses, whom the judge also observed. We would have preferred that the judge had specifically identified the supervisors'  testimony that conflicted with the testimony he discredited. However, we have reviewed the entire record and have noted above testimony by yardmasters  Westerfield and Murray that contradicts the employees' testimony that supervisors  encouraged violations. We cannot say that the judge erred in crediting the supervisors'  testimony rather than that of the switchmen.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote15_149_3484_65"/><label>15</label><bodyText><p> Former switchman  Connelly also testified generally that yardmasters  whom he did not identify threatened to shorten his lunch period or give him the least desirable jobs around the yard  if he did not keep defective cars in service as needed in scrap operations. Like the testimony of Warner, Thedford,  and Gillie Connelly's statements are contradicted by the testimony of Inland's supervisors. </p></bodyText></footnote> We therefore accept the judge's credibility determinations. <emphasis typeStyle="un">C.

For example, the only specific incident that Connelly discussed in sufficient detail to allow us to evaluate what he considered "harassment" seriously undermines his allegation, as the judge found. That was the incident involving former yardmaster  Lambert, discussed previously. The sum and substance of that incident is that Connelly concurred that the cars could be unloaded at the mill before being repaired, after Lambert "implored" <page number="59" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> him to do so because the cars were needed there. Connelly also testified that Lambert had had a heart attack "and was under very severe pressure to stay on the job, and we bent over backwards to keep Jim Lambert without stress or strain." We agree with the judge that this incident shows no harassment or coercion by Lambert.</p><p>Switchman  Dills also testified that he had violated safety rules to "[g]et the job done" and "[g]et in earlier, get better breaks" from the yardmasters.  However, the one specific instance he recounted in this regard does not support the implication that yardmasters  would reward him for breaking rules. Dills testified that "3 weeks ago I was working a little slower, I didn't feel that good that evening, and I was taking my time on my job, the Yard  Master got ticked off because I wasn't working any faster than I was. And he put me on a different job" which Dills considered to be a punishment because "[i]t's a little extra work . . . . there's not that much time, where you can get a good break on that other job." However, when Dills told the trainmaster that he was not feeling well he was permitted to go to the clinic. He took two days off work and returned<page number="60" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> without further incident. The judge correctly found that Dills's testimony that he was "harassed" in that instance had "no substance."</p><p>Lastly, the judge discredited the testimony of Dills that when he had been an hourly foreman in the Transportation Department for about one and one-half years ending in early 1978, other supervisors  falsified safety contract cards by writing down safety contacts with employees that never had occurred. After testifying to that effect, Dills admitted it was possible that those yardmasters  had made the safety contacts before he saw them fill out the cards, and that the only falsifications he could actually speak to were his own. We uphold the judge's finding that Dills' testimony regarding the possible falsifications by other yardmasters  "lack[ed] credibility." Insofar as Dill's falsifications are concerned, he admitted that Inland had taught him the correct way to fill out the cards, and that he could not confirm that any yardmasters  knew he falsified them. Indeed, Dills testified that he would not want Harding to find out because "[i]t's breaking a rule, his rule." Dills' admissions constitute the only proof of violations by any foreman or supervisor <page number="61" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> in this case. They were not safety rule violations, but concern a tangential matter -- safety contacts with switchmen  in the yards.  This idiosyncratic misconduct of a single hourly foreman over a year before the citation is too frail a reed to support this citation. <emphasis typeStyle="un">See</emphasis><citation type="case" normalizedCite="737 F.2d 350"><content><span normalizedCite="737 F.2d 350">Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co., 737 F.2d 350 (3d Cir. 1984).<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#350#3#000737#000350#"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation></p><p>Finally, the compliance officer testified that during his inspection, yardmaster  Murray went between two cars and manually operated a pin   lifter  in his presence. However, Murray testified that he had done so because he understood that the compliance officer had asked him "to demonstrate what we felt caused [Corona's] accident." Murray testified that the compliance officer then "asked me if it could be done without being between the draw bars" and Murray demonstrated that also. He testified that these demonstrations had occurred in the presence of a Mr. Jones of the safety department and Assistant Superintendent DuVall as well. Only later did the compliance officer discover that lifting pins  manually was a safety violation. Murray's testimony adequately explains the reason for demonstrating the manual lifting of a pin.  He did it to<page number="62" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/> satisfy what he understood to be a request by an OSHA inspector during the inspection. Exposure to hazards  due to complying with an OSHA inspector's perceived request is not grounds for issuance of a citation. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Cf.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle="un">Brown-McKee, Inc.,</emphasis><citation type="case" normalizedCite="80 OSAHRC 34"><content><span normalizedCite="80 O.S.H.

The Secretary relies on the Corona fatality as well as a fatality and several injuries that occurred in the 1960s to establish inadequacies. However, Corona, who was crushed between the drawbars of two railcars,  had been instructed in Inland's safety rules, had correctly answered the questions on Rule 43 in his switchman's  test, and had been orally reprimanded by trainmaster Webber three days before the fatality for violating Rule 43, as noted above. Yardmaster  Westerfield testified that Corona told him the morning he died, "Don't worry, I know Rule 43." There is no evidence that Corona was not properly instructed in Inland's safety rules or that Inland condoned his violation of those rules. It also should be noted that switchman   Thedford,  who blamed yardmasters  for failure to make sure that bad order cars were removed from service in certain cases, was on duty in Corona's area on the shift before Corona's fatality. Thedford  failed to report that one of the cars involved had a missing   pin   lifter,  which may have led Corona to go between them, where he was crushed.</p><p>As to the fatality and injuries that occurred in the 1960s, these also fail to show inadequacies in Inland's safety program at the time of the inspection or citations. The Secretary notes that a broken toe was suffered by switchman  Bastardo in 1969 when a stirrup broke on a car he was riding and his foot fell under a wheel.  However, the Secretary did not show that Inland should have detected a defect in that stirrup in advance. That incident established nothing about the adequacy of Inland's safety rules. A 1967 injury to switchman  Schutz occurred while he was standing between cars inspecting a defective coupling mechanism. However, that injury predated Rule 60, which prohibited going between railcars  having no pin   lifters.  A 1964 arm injury to switchman  Holland, the result of being pinned between railcars  while attempting to open a coupler, was due to his violation of Rule 43, according to Inland's accident report. A 1964 hand injury to coal bridge helper Wallace while setting blocks  on a coal tripper car, involved specialized coal handling equipment and is unrelated to Inland's railroad  operations, as the judge found. The cause of a fatality in 1960, in which an employee, Stubbs, was pinned between railcars,  was not established. Thus, these accidents do not prove that Inland had an inadequate safety program.</p></bodyText></footnote> Thus, the Secretary failed to prove a section 5(a)(1) violation with regard to the aspects of Inland's safety program at issue -- its rules for reporting  defective railcars  and uncoupling  railcars. </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p><page number="63" pageScheme="1986 OSAHRC LEXIS 87"/></p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>Because the Secretary failed to prove a section 5(a)(1) violation as to either citation item, we vacate the citation.
