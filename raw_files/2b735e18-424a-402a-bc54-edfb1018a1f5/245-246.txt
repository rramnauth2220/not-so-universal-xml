Following an inspection of the worksite,  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued Pullman a serious citation alleging violations of 29 C.F.R. § 1926.55(a) and (b), which require an employer to adopt measures to prevent employees from being exposed  to styrene levels above specified limits (Items 1a and 1b), and 29 C.F.R. § 1926.152(f)(3), which prohibits certain flammable liquids from being used within 50 feet of an ignition<page number="2" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 40"/> source (Item 2). The Secretary alleged under the multi-employer   worksite  doctrine that Pullman was a controlling employer on the project and therefore liable under all of the citation items for the exposure  of an employee of the specialty   subcontractor  to the cited conditions. The Secretary also alleged that Pullman's own employees were exposed  to the conditions at issue under Item 2. OSHA proposed a total penalty of $ 8,000.</p><p>Administrative Law Judge Dennis L. Phillips granted partial   summary judgment  to Pullman; he dismissed Items 1a and 1b, and dismissed Item 2 only to the extent it was based on the alleged exposure  of the subcontractor's  employee. In so ruling, the judge properly relied on then-current Commission precedent under <emphasis typeStyle="it">Summit Contractors, Inc.</emphasis>, which held that the controlling employer theory of liability when applied to an alleged violation on a multi-employer  construction worksite  was invalid. <citation type="case" normalizedCite="21 OSHC (BNA) 2020"><content><span normalizedCite="21 O.S.H.

(Tr. 262). Approximately 110 employees worked at the McConnelsville, Ohio facility, which MAHLE purchased in 2006. (Tr. 108, 277). The facility consisted of a north building and a south building. (Tr. 278). The south building housed MAHLE's finishing  department. (Tr. 278). In the finishing  department, employees modified lead-coated steel coils on finish mills or cut it for special applications. <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_22_200_126"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> Air monitoring in the finishing  department showed there was no employee exposure  to lead over the action level. (Tr.267).</p></bodyText></footnote> (Tr. 230, 266).</p><p>The north building housed the casting  department and had two casting  lines. (Tr. 278; RX-9, p. 3). MAHLE generally operated the casting  lines for three shifts per day. (Tr. 64, 323). To produce a coil of<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> lead-coated steel, a steel strip was cleaned,  preheated to 2,000 [degrees] F, and then cast with the molten bronze alloy. (RX-9, p. 3; Tr. 262). The bronze alloy consisted of 20% lead. (RX-9, p. 3). Next, the strip moved to the quench chute where it was cooled with quench oil and then machined to a specified thickness to produce the coated steel. (RX-9). The coated steel was either sent out to other plants to create products, such as bearings and bushings, or sent to MAHLE's finishing  department. (Tr. 262).</p><p>Lead fumes were released at certain stages in the casting  process. (RX-9, p. 3). Through air monitoring, MAHLE determined that lead exposure  was at or above the action level <footnote><anchor id="fnote4_25_238_56"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p> The action level (AL) is 30 [mu] g/m&lt;3&gt; averaged over an 8-hour period. <citation type="regulation" id="I5GCMCV72D6MVG0060000400" normalizedCite="29 C.F.R. 1910.1025"><content><span normalizedCite="29 C.F.R. 1910.1025 (b)">29 C.F.R. § 1910.1025(b)<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#14829#571#000029#000001910 #                         1025 #"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>.</p></bodyText></footnote> in one area of the casting  department. (Tr. 262). This area -- the lead zone  -- was outlined with floor tape. (Tr. 263; RX-9, p. 4).</p><p>There were four work positions in the casting  department: a welder at the front of the casting line,  a person working on the "pots," a person working at the chute area, and another at the end of the line removing the coils and running the front loader. (Tr. 265-66). <page number="5" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> Two of these work positions were in the lead zone:  one near the beginning of the casting line  by the pots of molten alloy and one next to the quench oven. (Tr. 224, 263, 266). Employees wore portable air purifying respirators (PAPRs) while working in the two lead-zone work positions. (Tr. 266). The other two work positions in the casting  department were not in the lead zone,  so PAPR was not used. <footnote><anchor id="fnote5_27_287_36"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p> On rare occasions there was a "dump" in the casting  department and all employees wore PAPR at that time. (Tr.266).</p></bodyText></footnote> (Tr. 266).</p><p>Each casting  department employee was cross-trained in both lead-zone work positions and non-lead-zone work positions. (Tr. 224, 261). The employees regularly rotated between a lead zone  position and a non-lead zone  position to minimize lead exposure.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote6_29_308_41"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p> [Redacted], a finishing  department employee, testified that he had previously been assigned  to the casting  department and was trained for three positions there.

As a finishing  department employee he occasionally filled-infor a casting  department employee when there was an unforeseen employee shortage. (Tr. 225).</p></bodyText></footnote> (Tr. 261). Occasionally, an employee assigned  to the finishing  department filled-in for a casting  department employee. (Tr. 225, 229, 273-74). When a finishing  department employee filled in for a casting  department employee he only worked in a lead-zone position if he had recently been a casting  department employee.

Administrative controls included rotating employees in and out of the work positions with the highest lead exposure.  Respiratory controls, such as PAPRs, were used when an employee worked in the lead zone.  Engineering controls included forced air ventilation and HEPA air filters in the break room. (Tr. 270; RX-9, p. 5).</p><p>A key component in MAHLE's lead exposure  control plan was its decontamination procedures. MAHLE had two levels of decontamination for its employees -- Level One and Level Two. <footnote><anchor id="fnote7_33_380_519"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p> This reflects the process that was in place at the time of the OSHA inspection  during the fall and winter of 2012. (Tr. 267).</p></bodyText></footnote> (RX-6, p. 4). Level Two was used at the end of an employee's shift before leaving for the day and Level One was for breaks during a work shift. (Tr. 269; RX-6, p. 4). The Level One decontamination process for an employee taking a break took about 17 minutes. (Tr. 268). An employee went through the Level One decontamination process multiples times during a work shift. (Tr. 268).</p><p><page number="7" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/></p><p>MAHLE's decontamination process had two levels with several steps for each level. First, for the Level One process, the employee washed his hands and face and boots upon leaving the casting  department. (Tr. 267-69; RX-6, p.4). Second, he moved into the downdraft booth of Decontamination Room One. The downdraft booth used a burst of air from overhead to remove lead as the employee turned around and the air was pulled through filters beneath the employee's feet. (Tr. 267-268). Third, the employee removed his PAPR or hardhat, cleaned  the PAPR and PAPR locker,  placed the cleaning   wipes  in the hazardous waste bin, and stored the PAPR in its locker.  Finally, he completed the respirator maintenance log, washed and stored his hard hat on a hook, washed his hands and face again, and exited Decontamination Room One. (RX-6, p. 4; Tr. 267-69). Employees walked on a sticky mat to remove lead from shoes. (Tr. 267).</p><p>For Level Two decontamination, first, the employee completed the steps of Level One decontamination. Then, he proceeded into the downdraft booth at Decontamination Room Two. (RX-6, p.4). Next, he used the boot wash and washed his hands and face. (RX-6, p.4). Then, the employee proceeded<page number="8" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> to the dirty side of the locker room  to remove his used work uniform, which he placed in a container for the laundry service. (Tr. 269). Thereafter, he showered and proceeded to the clean  side of the locker room.  Finally, he dressed in the clothing he wore to work and left for the day. (Tr. 269).</p><p>In addition to its internal controls and procedures, MAHLE contracted with four companies for lead-related services: Cintas, ServiceMaster, Genesis Healthcare System (Genesis) and Helix Environmental (Helix). Cintas collected  and cleaned  MAHLE's contaminated work clothing. (Tr. 269). ServiceMaster provided both general cleaning  services throughout the facility and cleaning  in the areas with potential lead accumulation.  (CX-23; Tr. 288-89). Dr. Eric Newsome, of Genesis, was the occupational health physician for MAHLE's medical surveillance program. (Tr. 407). Dr. Newsome reviewed the results from the blood tests for the employees' lead and zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) levels. <footnote><anchor id="fnote8_37_440_272"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p> John Feather, plant manager,  testified that the union contract required the 6-month blood testing  schedule for casting line  employees and blood testing  for employee transfers from the finishing  department. (Tr. 272).</p></bodyText></footnote> (Tr. 407).</p><p><page number="9" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/></p><p>In 2007, MAHLE retained Ralph Froehlich of Helix for consulting on industrial hygiene issues. (Tr. 310; JX-1, p. 12). Froehlich provided general consulting and conducted on-site industrial hygiene reviews of MAHLE's facility. During a facility visit, he assessed and tested  for occupational health hazards and possible employee exposure.  (JX-1, p. 13). Froehlich visited MAHLE's facility in 2009, 2010, and three times in 2012. (JX-1, pp. 12-13, 36). Froelich's May 22, 2012 facility-wide review assessed several employee safety and health issues, such as personal protective equipment, noise, airborne dust, lead, copper, tin and hydrocarbons. (JX-1, p. 36, 38). Froelich prepared a 45-page report based on the results of the May 2012 review.

(Tr. 40). No MAHLE safety professionals were available that day, so he returned on October 15, 2012, to conduct the walk-around inspection  of the facility. (Tr. 41). During the walk-around, the CO took photographs and collected  four wipe  samples to test for lead accumulation.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote9_41_493_23"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p> At MAHLE's request, Froehlich also collected  lead wipe  samples on October 15, 2012.

(Tr. 56-58; CX-2). However, there are four primary issues with using the data from these three exhibits to support the alleged violations.</p><p><page number="20" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/></p><p>The first issue is that the sampling  date and shipping date of the SLTC report did not correspond to the CO's December 10 collection date. (CX-4). The 78065 SLTC report had a "sampling  date" of October 15, 2012, not December 10, 2012, as alleged by the Secretary. <footnote><anchor id="fnote19_82_1321_275"/><label>19</label><bodyText><p>Secretary's counsel noted that the results must be from the CO's December samples because "there won't be any evidence that this is sampling  from any other date."

The shipping date on the 78065 SLTC report was recorded as October 17, 2012 (prior to the CO's December 10 collection date). (CX-4). The CO testified that, even though the 78065 SLTC laboratory report  had a date of October 15 <footnote><anchor id="fnote20_82_1324_236"/><label>20</label><bodyText><p> The laboratory report  for the prior October samples had sampling  report number 78005 reflected a sampling  date of October 15, 2012. The report shows a received-in-lab date of October 26, 2012 and analysis completed on November 2, 2012. The samples on the October 15 report were designated as S1, S2, S3, and S4. (RX-1, pp. 48-50).</p></bodyText></footnote>, he knew the report was actually for the December 10, 2012 samples because "these are the six samples that I took, along with the blank from that day. And it directly corresponds with the -- with my actual sampling worksheet. " (Tr. 53). The CO also testified that he believed the October 15 date on the 78065 SLTC report had been mistakenly carried forward by the SLTC laboratory  from an earlier report related to samples he had submitted to SLTC in October. (Tr. 52). Respondent did not stipulate that the results shown in Complainant's Exhibit Four represented results from the samples taken by the CO on December 10, 2012. (Tr. 54).</p><p><page number="21" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/></p><p>Second, the sample (submission) numbers on the 78065 SLTC laboratory report  do not match those from the CO's 78065 inspection   worksheet.  (CX-3, CX-4). The laboratory report  shows results for samples S1, S2, S3, S4, S-15, and S-16. (CX-4). There are no samples designated as S1, S2, S3, and S4 on the CO's 78065 (December 10, 2012) inspection   worksheet.  The CO's sample numbers were from S11 through S16. No one from the lab testified, or otherwise verified, that the results reported in SLTC 78065 report were related to the samples collected  by the CO on December 10, 2012. (CX-4). There was no explanation for discrepancy in the sample numbers.</p><p>Third, the meaning of the numerical results on the SLTC laboratory report  is not in the record. There was no testimony, affidavit, or other evidence from laboratory  personnel describing or verifying the results<page number="22" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> and the meaning of those results. <footnote><anchor id="fnote21_86_1389_601"/><label>21</label><bodyText><p> The parties agreed prior to the hearing that the lab personnel would not have to testify and that the report would speak for itself. (Tr. 53). Respondent did not stipulate that the results on CX-4 represent the results for the sampling  the CO conducted on December 10, 2012. (Tr. 53-54).</p></bodyText></footnote> (Tr. 52-53). Instead, the Secretary chose to let the lab samples "sort of speak for themselves...." (Tr. 53). For example, there was no information in the report that described the meaning of a particular result, such as the result "12.2000" under the category of "Lead, inorganic" for submission number S-15. (CX-4). There was no supplemental report that described and explained the results. In particular, there was no description of the relative unit of measurement that the reported lead results were based upon (i.e., per square foot, per cubic foot, etc.).</p><p>The meaning of the laboratory  results on the SLTC report is essential because the CO's final calculated lead concentration  levels are based on results in the SLTC report. For example, with respect to sample S12 taken on December 10, 2012, the CO testified that the lead concentration,  after the conversion<page number="23" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> to square-foot, was 1,536 [mu] g/ft&lt;2&gt; based on the SLTC laboratory  result of "64 micrograms." (Tr. 56; CX-2). However, the SLTC report, which purported to provide the results of the December 10 sampling,  had no sample or submission designated as "S12." (CX-4). Further, there was no "64 micrograms" result for lead on the SLTC report for any sample number analyzed. (CX-4). Consequently, the CO's calculated lead concentration  for S12 cannot be reconciled with the SLTC report.</p><p>Fourth, there was no evidence to verify the chain-of-custody procedures upon receipt at the SLTC laboratory.  In particular, there was no explanation of why the sample (submission) numbers for the laboratory report  (S1 through S4, S-15, S-16) do not match the CO's submitted sample numbers (S11 through S16). (CX-4, CX-3). No one from the laboratory  confirmed the results on the SLTC laboratory report  were from the samples collected  by the CO on December 10. On its face, the SLTC laboratory report  cannot be reconciled with the CO's inspection   worksheet. </p><p>When viewed as a whole, I am not confident in the data the Secretary relied upon to support his allegations. The CO used the SLTC laboratory  results to calculate<page number="24" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> a squared-foot lead concentration.  (Tr. 56-58). There is not a dispute that the report was from SLTC and generally related to lead sampling;  however, the meaning of the reported results is not in evidence. The report, standing on its own, is incomplete and does not explain the value of a particular reported result. For example, without its relative unit of measure, a reported result of 12.2 micrograms is not useful. Despite the fact that the Secretary did not call anyone from the lab to testify regarding the sampling  results, Respondent did not object to their admission into evidence as Complainant's Exhibit # 4. (Tr. 49).

First, the operational status of MAHLE's casting line  around the time of each lead sampling  was not considered. Lead emissions were produced during the normal operation of the casting line.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote27_108_1996_58"/><label>27</label><bodyText><p> In 2012, the casting line  had two-week shutdowns in July, November, and at year-end.

Further, at several times throughout the year the casting line  was not operational, so no lead emissions were produced.

In its analysis, the Commission considered the employer's "substantial efforts to comply with its obligation under the cited standard" through daily cleaning.  Similarly, MAHLE implemented several measures to mitigate the accumulation  of lead in its facility and also increased its cleaning  schedule to three times per day (once per shift) in 2010. (Tr. 271). Thus, OSHA's sampling  results of October 2012 do not establish the practicable  lead level for MAHLE.</p><p>The Secretary also asserts that MAHLE's high lead results were due to Service Master's improper cleaning  method. (Sec. Br. 2, 11). The evidence is insufficient to support this assertion. During the December 10, 2012 inspection, <page number="32" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> the CO testified that he had observed ServiceMaster staff using a "dry" method to clean  with a dirty rag: "I didn't see a wet bucket or a clean  bucket, a rinsing bucket or multiple cloths." (Tr. 49-50). The CO explained, "[a]s I was getting ready to sample, the cleaning  staff there was -- had just finished wiping all the surfaces  down. They were on their way out when I was getting ready to sample." (Tr. 47). The CO's inspection   worksheet  from December 2012 included his notation of "freshly cleaned   surfaces. " (Tr. 47, 49-50; Exh. C-3). The CO testified that he also observed ServiceMaster cleaning  during the October inspection,  but did not document that observation. (Tr. 47, 49, 140-42).</p><p>The CO's observation is the only evidence regarding Service Master's use of an ineffective cleaning  method. To the contrary, Froehlich testified he had observed the use of a wet cleaning  method. <footnote><anchor id="fnote28_112_2138_46"/><label>28</label><bodyText><p> Mr. Froehlich observed cleaning  at MAHLE's facility during his visits even though he was not asked to critique the cleaning  process.

Additionally, the plant manager  was surprised because MAHLE's training specified the use of a wet cleaning  method, MAHLE provided lead-cleaning products for Service Master's use, and rags could be cleaned  in the same area the CO observed the dry-method cleaning.  (Tr. 281).</p><p><page number="33" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/></p><p>A determination of whether Service Master's cleaning  was inadequate cannot be made without specific facts about how the cleaning  was performed the day of the inspection  and if that was indicative of the generally utilized cleaning  method. A one-time observation, and its resulting assumption, does not establish that ServiceMaster was generally using an inadequate cleaning  method. Further, if ServiceMaster generally used an ineffective cleaning  method it seems unlikely that OSHA's October sampling  could have resulted in non-detectable lead levels. When asked to explain how this could occur, the CO supposed that maybe they "got lucky" and "cleaned  right" that day. (Tr. 61).</p><p>The record is insufficient to support the assertion that ServiceMaster was generally using inadequate cleaning  methods at the MAHLE facility.</p><p>Further, the Secretary made much of its assertion that ServiceMaster did not always clean  three times per day. (Tr. 10; Sec. Br. 8-9). The Secretary attempted to prove this point by showing that there were not three initialed cleaning  log entries for each day. (Tr. 299-300; Sec. Br. 8). ServiceMaster utilized cleaning  logs to show when each area in the MAHLE facility had been<page number="34" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/>  cleaned  with an employee's initials on a checklist. (Tr. 297, 300; CX-16). The Secretary claims that MAHLE made a "promise" to change its cleaning  schedule to three times per day as a part of its settlement agreement with OSHA from a 2009 inspection.  (Tr. 10). However, the cited standard does not specify the frequency of cleaning  and the Secretary has not presented evidence to show that cleaning  three times per day is the sole means to maintain surface  lead at a practicable  level.

(Tr. 140-41; Sec. Br. 9). However, the CO was unsure at which visit, October or December, he told MAHLE's safety manager of his concerns about Service Master's cleaning  method. (Tr. 141-42). Thus, the CO's discussion with MAHLE does not establish knowledge of possible<page number="36" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> inadequate lead cleaning  prior to the December inspection. </p><p>Also, Helix's 2012 lead sampling  results do not support knowledge prior to the December inspection.  The record is clear that Helix collected  widespread samples throughout MAHLE's facility on May 22, 2012. However, there is no evidence as to when the resulting 45-page report was completed and sent to MAHLE. (CX-8). Also, there is no evidence about the usual elapsed time between Helix's collection of samples and a report's submission to the client to infer a possible date. Thus, this report cannot be used to establish MAHLE's knowledge of inadequate cleaning.  The evidence does not show that any of MAHLE's supervisory personnel had actual knowledge of any excessive lead contamination  or that the break room was not as free of lead as practicable. </p><p>To establish constructive knowledge the Secretary must show that with reasonable diligence MAHLE could have known of the condition of high lead concentration  in its break room.

(Sec. Br. 8, 11). The Secretary states that MAHLE's oversight of ServiceMaster was insufficient because it did not monitor the cleaning  reports, it did not observe Service Master's cleaning  methods, and it did not ensure that ServiceMaster understood the hazards of lead. (Sec. Br. 8).</p><p>First, the Secretary asserts that MAHLE did not review Service Master's cleaning  reports to determine if ServiceMaster was cleaning  the break room three times per day. I disagree. I find that ServiceMaster did routinely  review Service Master's cleaning  reports.</p><p>After a 2009 OSHA inspection,  in which MAHLE was cited for inadequate housekeeping,  MAHLE increased<page number="38" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> the cleaning  schedule for ServiceMaster from twice a day to three times a day. (Tr. 64, 271, 295). This was done to coincide with the three work shifts per day that MAHLE typically ran. (Tr. 64, 271, 323). MAHLE also developed a cleaning  log for Service Master's use. (RX-8, p.19). The cleaning  log included a daily checklist of each area to be cleaned  and a space for the ServiceMaster employee to initial each time an area was cleaned  during the day. (RX-8, p.19). A ServiceMaster supervisor   collected  these logs and submitted them to MAHLE's purchasing office each week. (Tr. 286, 356).</p><p>The Secretary presented several cleaning  reports to show there were instances when the reports were not initialed to show an area had been cleaned  three times on a particular day. (Tr. 285-86, 297; CX-16; RX-8, pp. 22-23). MAHLE effectively refutes this evidence.</p><p>The plant manager,  John Feather, <footnote><anchor id="fnote29_127_2696_88"/><label>29</label><bodyText><p> Feather worked for MAHLE a total of 11 years and became the McConnelsville plant manager  in 2010. (Tr. 257,278).</p></bodyText></footnote> testified that the instances generally coincided with times that the casting line  did not operate for three shifts per day or was shut down. (Tr. 300, 304). During a shut-down, MAHLE did not process lead. (Tr. 325-26). Feather stated that he did not expect ServiceMaster to clean  three times each day when all<page number="39" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> three shifts were not in production or the casting line  was not operating. (Tr. 300, 325-26). Feather stated that MAHLE did routinely  review the cleaning  reports to make sure ServiceMaster was following the three-times-per-day schedule. (Tr. 295-97). Additionally, each week a ServiceMaster supervisor  went to the facility to spot-check the cleaning  and turn in the cleaning  reports. (Tr. 356). Kim McNeish, the supervisor  for Service Master's cleaning  porters, had weekly discussions with MAHLE management to address cleaning  issues. (Tr. 364, 369).</p><p>A January 2011 email also shows MAHLE reviewed the cleaning  reports from ServiceMaster. (RX-8, p. 16). In that email to ServiceMaster, MAHLE noted that it had observed improvements in the cleaning  after the change to three times per day and asked for additional improvements, such as timing the cleaning  to occur just after a shift change. (RX-8, p. 16). I find that MAHLE did actively review the cleaning  reports to determine if ServiceMaster was following the cleaning  schedule and that its review was reasonable.</p><p>Second, the<page number="40" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/>Secretary asserts that if MAHLE had observed Service Master's cleaning  it would have known that ServiceMaster used an ineffective method (dry cloth) to clean.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote30_130_2767_75"/><label>30</label><bodyText><p> The only record evidence of ServiceMaster utilizing a dry method of cleaning  was the CO's testimony that he had seen the cleaning  during his visits.</p></bodyText></footnote> (Sec. Br. 8, 11). The CO testified that he had observed ServiceMaster cleaning  during both of his visits; however, only his December inspection worksheet  records this observation plus he was unsure when he had informed MAHLE management of his observation. (Tr. 47, 49, 140-41).</p><p>MAHLE also monitored the effectiveness of cleaning  by using a quick-test stick to detect surface  lead. (Tr. 279-280). This quick-test was routinely  done throughout the facility to evaluate cleaning.  The quick-test stick immediately indicated the presence (but not the amount) of lead. (Tr. 279-280). As an example, Feather stated that a quick-test had indicated lead was present on the employees' time clock. MAHLE presented the problem to ServiceMaster and found the time clock was not being cleaned.  MAHLE immediately required ServiceMaster to routinely   clean  the time clock. (Tr. 280).</p><p>The evidence<page number="41" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> shows that MAHLE did oversee the facility's cleaning.  MAHLE routinely  addressed issues regarding cleaning  methods, provided lead cleaning  solutions and provided training to ServiceMaster that noted wet mops and wet rags were needed to prevent re-entry of lead into a clean  environment. (Tr. 281, 293, 295-96; RX-8, p. 4). Cleaning  issues were addressed weekly with a ServiceMaster supervisor.  (Tr. 369). Further, the evidence does not show that the plant manager  had reason to believe ServiceMaster was using a dry-cloth method. <footnote><anchor id="fnote31_133_2838_160"/><label>31</label><bodyText><p> I noted Feather's demeanor during his testimony. His surprise appeared to be genuine. This, coupled with the record evidence, indicates Feather did not have any knowledge of a dry-method cleaning  being used. (Tr. 281).</p></bodyText></footnote> (Tr. 281). It is not reasonable to expect MAHLE to continuously observe Service Master's cleaning.  I find that MAHLE took reasonable measures to oversee Service Master's cleaning  methods and, in particular, its use of a quick-test stick to detect the presence of lead on surfaces. </p><p>Third, the Secretary asserts that MAHLE should have known Service Master's cleaning  was inadequate because ServiceMaster was not a lead cleaning  specialist and, <page number="42" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> therefore, not properly trained in lead hazards and cleaning.  (Sec. Br. 11). The evidence does not support this assertion.</p><p>MAHLE provided training and information to ServiceMaster, including its lead exposure  control plan. (RX-8, p. 13; RX-9). ServiceMaster reviewed MAHLE's lead exposure  control plan and its management employees attended MAHLE's training. (Tr. 282-83, 351, 355-56, 362-63; RX-8, p. 10). The evidence shows that MAHLE made continuous efforts to educate Service Master's management about the hazards of lead at its facility. I find that MAHLE's efforts to inform ServiceMaster of the lead hazards at the facility were reasonable.</p><p>As a whole, the record shows that MAHLE made reasonable efforts to have effective cleaning  for the break room and did not have knowledge that cleaning  may have been inadequate. The Secretary did not establish constructive knowledge.</p><p>The Secretary did not prove that the standard's terms were violated or that MAHLE had knowledge of the violative condition by a preponderance of the evidence.

The casting line  was a critical part of MAHLE's production process and operated most of the year. Employees assigned  to the casting line   routinely  worked within the lead zone.

To determine which employees must be tested  every 6 months, the Secretary must first establish which employees were, or were expected to be, exposed at or above the action level more than 30 days in a year. <footnote><anchor id="fnote37_176_3762_168"/><label>37</label><bodyText><p> The record provides no information on when a year begins or ends for purposes of the cited standard.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Here, the Secretary asserts that five employees ([Redacted], [Redacted], [Redacted], [Redacted], and [Redacted]) were exposed and not tested  as required. (Sec. Br. 15-16). The Secretary selected these five employees in two ways. First, based on the CO's interviews certain employees were assumed to routinely  work in the casting  department. Second, the Secretary appears to have used MAHLE's lead and ZPP blood testing  reports for the 2012 calendar year <footnote><anchor id="fnote38_178_3780_82"/><label>38</label><bodyText><p> The blood testing  results were in three separate reports -- one for the time frame 01/01/12 to 10/15/2012, the second for 11/14/12 to 11/16/12, and the third for 12/5/12 to 12/5/12.

(Sec. Br. 16; CX-13). The Secretary provided no evidence of which MAHLE employees actually worked in the casting  department for more than<page number="53" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> 30 days in a year or those employees eligible to fill-in for a casting  department employee in that year. (Tr. 139).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">1. [Redacted]</emphasis></p><p>The allegation that [Redacted] was not adequately tested  was based on a statement from the human resources director to the CO that [Redacted] was a supervisor  in the casting  department. (Tr. 83-84). The CO stated that he did not base exposure  for [Redacted] on incidental exposure  (i.e., popping his head into the lead zone) ; instead, he based it on [Redacted] working as a supervisor  in the lead zone.  (Tr. 137-138).</p><p>However, the plant manager  explained that [Redacted]'s job duties as a supervisor  do not require him to be in the lead zone,  so testing  was not required. (Tr. 265). Only two of the work positions on the casting line  were in the lead zone.  (Tr. 265-66). There is no evidence that [Redacted] worked in either of the two lead zone  positions. Finally, in a signed affidavit, [Redacted] stated "[m]y job seldom requires me to be in the<page number="54" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> lead zone  areas other than for short period [sic] of time to observe the operation; I do not recall how many times I would have been in the lead zone  in 2012 but I do not believe it was over 30 instances." (RX-7).</p><p>I find that the evidence does not demonstrate that [Redacted] actually worked, or was anticipated to work, in the lead zone  more than 30 days in a year; therefore, testing  every 6 months was not required.

[Redacted]</emphasis></p><p>The allegation that [Redacted] was not adequately tested  was based on the CO's interview with [Redacted] in which he told the CO he had not received any recent blood tests.

However, the CO could not recall when he interviewed [Redacted]. <footnote><anchor id="fnote39_185_3879_212"/><label>39</label><bodyText><p> The notes from this interview are not in the record and the date of the interview is not in the record.</p></bodyText></footnote> (Tr. 137). The plant manager  explained that [Redacted] had been on an extended leave-of-absence (6 month lay-off) during 2012, so [Redacted] was tested  after he returned to work and the casting  lines were restarted in December. (Tr. 274). The blood testing  records confirm that [Redacted] received blood testing  on December 5, 2012. (CX-13, p. 17).</p><p><page number="55" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/></p><p>I find the Secretary provided no evidence that [Redacted] had been working during a time in 2012 that was more than 6 months from his previous blood testing.  Further, the evidence supports Respondent's assertion that [Redacted] was tested  upon return from his leave-of-absence.

(CX-13, p. 1,7).</p><p>The plant manager  testified that when MAHLE anticipated a finishing  department employee might be needed back on the casting  side, that employee was tested.  (Tr. 273-74).

The Secretary did not prove that the Respondent's testing  for [Redacted] was not compliant with the cited standard.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">4.

[Redacted] had not been specifically identified as a casting  department employee. (Tr. 130-32). The Secretary alleged that more than 6 months elapsed between [Redacted]'s blood tests; records show he was tested  on January 19, 2012, and then again on November 14, 2012. (Sec. Br. 16; CX-13, p. 4, 9).</p><p>[Redacted] confirmed that [Redacted] was assigned  to the finishing  department, not the casting  department. (Tr. 226).

Again, <page number="57" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> the Secretary provided no evidence as to when [Redacted] worked, or was expected to work, in the casting  department during 2012. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to show that [Redacted] was not tested  when he worked, or was expected to work, in the lead zone  more than 30 days in a year. In other words, because [Redacted] was assigned  to the finishing  department it is unknown when or if MAHLE anticipated he would fill-in at the casting  department's lead zone  during 2012. The Secretary did not prove that the Respondent's testing  for [Redacted] was not compliant with the cited standard.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">5.

The records show [Redacted] was tested  on January 20, 2012, and then again on November 15, 2012, ten months later. (CX-13, p. 4, 9). Here again, it appears that [Redacted]'s selection as an exposed employee was based on the CO's general understanding that all employees on a blood testing  report were assigned  to work in the casting  department.

The record is silent on whether [Redacted] was assigned  to the casting <page number="58" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 39"/> or finishing  department.</p><p>[Redacted] testified that [Redacted] took a three-month leave of absence during 2012.

The Secretary did not prove that Respondent's testing  for [Redacted] was not compliant with the cited standard.</p><p>I find the Secretary has not shown that any MAHLE employee with actual or expected exposure  above the action level more than 30 days had not been tested  every 6 months as required.

On the morning  of November 18, 2013, a Monday, a CTS crew was preparing to continue<page number="3" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> offloading cargo  from a ship,  the <emphasis typeStyle="it">Yangtze Xing Jin</emphasis>, to a barge  on the Mississippi River in Darrow, Louisiana (Tr. 100). The cargo  comprised numerous sacks  (also referred to as bags) , each weighing "anywhere from a ton to two tons." (Tr. 33.) <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_17_237_68"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> None of the witnesses who testified identified the contents of the sacks  in his testimony. The Crane Operator stated, "[W]hat was in the sacks,  I don't know." (Tr. 34.) In his Inspection  Report, CSHO Nevers identified the contents of the sacks  as <emphasis typeStyle="it">Cenospheres</emphasis>, "hollow ceramic microspheres used as a filler in cement to produce concrete."(Exh. C-2, p. 7.)</p></bodyText></footnote> The barge  was approximately 100 feet long and 24 feet wide (Tr. 82-83). The hold of the barge  was 12 to 14 feet deep (Tr. 108).</p><p>A CTS crew had begun offloading the cargo  from the <emphasis typeStyle="it">Yangtze Xing Jin</emphasis> over the weekend. <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_19_270_35"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> The Barge   Foreman  had not worked on the barge  at issue the previous day and had not participated in the partial loading of the barge  (Tr. 46). The Crane Operator and Employee A, but not Employee B, had worked on the barge  the previous day (Tr. 29, 82).</p></bodyText></footnote> Offloading a ship  "can typically last from five to ten days, depending on the amount of cargo,  the weather . . ., and other variables." (Tr. 102.) When the Monday morning  shift began at 8:00 a.m., the hold (also referred to as the hopper) of the barge  was partially filled with six rows of sacks.  The first row of sacks  was stacked  six high, the second row<page number="4" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> was stacked  five high, and so on, in stair-step fashion to the sixth row, which was a single sack  high (Exh. C-3, p. 3; Tr. 249, 254).</p><p>The CTS employees present at the start of the shift were the Shift Supervisor,  the Barge   Foreman,  the Crane Operator, and two laborers,  Employee A and Employee B. The Shift Supervisor  supervised the overall offloading operation for CTS (Tr. 126-127). The Barge   Foreman  reported to the Shift Supervisor  and directly supervised Employees A and B (Tr. 42, 103). The Shift Supervisor  was on the deck  of the <emphasis typeStyle="it">Yangtze Xing Jin</emphasis>, which was 30 to 40 feet higher than the barge.  From that position, the Shift Supervisor  could observe "a large portion of the barge  that's on the off side of the derrick rig. " (Tr. 128.) The Crane Operator was on the barge,  operating the crane (Tr. 129).</p><p>The crew who worked the previous shift had placed hatch covers (lightweight fiberglass covers used to protect cargo  from<page number="5" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> the elements) over the stacked   sacks  in the barge  hold because it had been raining (Tr. 25-26). The first task the Barge   Foreman  assigned Employee A and Employee B the morning  of November 18 was to hook hatch covers so the Crane Operator could remove them from the cargo  in the hold (Tr. 26). The CTS employees worked at this task until "a little after 10:00." (Tr. 44.) At some point, Employee B entered the hold of the barge  by climbing  down the stacked   sacks,  using them as stairs (Tr. 27). After Employee B used the stacked   sacks  to enter the hold, Employee A did the same. Employee B described the tragic event that followed:<excerpt><bodyText><p>I see her climb  into the barge  and she starts to walk down the sacks  to get to the bottom. In the process of her walking down the sacks  she steps on the 3rd row from the bottom and the sacks  shifted. When they shifted she regained her footing and then she sat down on it. She [slid] off the sack  and was standing but the sack  she was sitting on kept sliding down and came down on top of and pinned her in a hole between the floor and the sack. </p><p>* * *</p><p>I hollered for anybody. I went to see if she was breathing but she wasn't responding so I climbed  the sacks <page number="6" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> to get out of the barge.  I got the attention of a guy on the ship;  he got the attention of the crane operator. Then guys working on the deck  of the dock came on the barge  and we started moving sacks  from around her so we could get to her. After I removed the sacks  from around her I got out of the barge.  I don't know how long it took the ambulance to get there and I wasn't there when they removed her from the barge. </p></bodyText></excerpt>(Exh. C-14, pp. 3-5.) Employee A was fifty-six years old. She had started working for CTS in February 2013, approximately nine months before her death (Exhs. C-2, p.6; R-10).</p><p>CSHO Nevers arrived at the site later that day. He held an opening conference with Byron Borne, CTS's Regional Loss Control Director (Exh. C-2, pp. 2, 17). CSHO interviewed employees and took photographs of the hold of the barge.

(CTS's brief, p 19.) This reference to the fixed ladder  is apparently an afterthought on the part of CTS. It did not argue at the hearing that the fixed ladder  was the means of access provided to reach the hold. CTS's expert witness John Faulk, who never observed the barge  at issue (Tr. 239), made a passing reference to fixed ladders  in general: "Quite often, fixed ladders  on each end of the barge  [are] blocked out with cargo,  very common." (Tr. 246.) No fixed ladder  is visible in the only photographs in the record (Exhs. C-3, R-7). Furthermore, in his witness statement, Employee B said, "There is a ladder  on the bow of the barge  connected to the barge.  I climbed  down that ladder   <emphasis typeStyle="it">and then climbed  down the cargo </emphasis>." (Exh.C-14, p. 7).

However, I can tell you I have corrected many a barge   foreman,  many a crane operator for not having a ladder  in the barge  while people were working. So could it have happened that day? Sure. But as I recall, it didn't happen on that day<page number="12" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> on that crane.

He testified that on the morning  of November 18, 2013, he was working outside of the barge,  Employee A was on the deck  of the barge,  and Employee B was "on the inside toward the stern." (Tr. 42.) The Barge   Foreman  related, unprompted, his version of the events that morning: <excerpt><bodyText><p>And as we were restacking the covers, I went along and then come to find out, the<page number="14" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/>  young lady,  she jumped in the barge  without me knowing, without me setting up the ladder  and stuff so she could proceed to go down the ladder  the correct way. So I mean, as I was coming along, I didn't see her, you know, jump in the barge  because I was walking on the off side. But if I would have saw her, I would have stopped her, you know. But no one told her to jump into the barge,  to go down that way, because you know, I worked with her in that area once before and I never had a problem with her about doing it that way. So all of a sudden, she just done it on her own and not even was following directions to be told something like that. You know, I don't know why she done it, but she done it, and that was it.</p></bodyText></excerpt>(Tr. 42-43.)</p><p>The Barge   Foreman  conceded it was his responsibility to set up a ladder  for access to the cargo  hold that morning  and that he had not fulfilled this responsibility at the time of Employee A's fatal accident. Immediately after conceding it was his responsibility to set up the ladder,  however, the Barge   Foreman  reverted to blaming Employee A for her accident.<excerpt><bodyText><p>I have a little objection to how you're saying it, you know, about I'm not fulfilling my<page number="15" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> obligation. See, it's a process that no one is supposed to do anything before the barge   foreman  let them know what to do. You know, that was my job as the barge   foreman  to let them know how to proceed. So until I finish all of my operations step-by-step, and then they will proceed to go into the area of work. But at this time, this young lady,  she wasn't told or asked to do anything but stay on the rig.  That was her position, to stay on the rig,  not to even enter in that work area until I, as the barge   foreman,  let her know that it was safe  for her to get in the areas to go to work. And it wasn't even told by me; much less let her do that, but she overrided on her own thinking ability to get up on the ladder,  to get in the working area on her own without even being authorized to be in that area. So I mean, she should know after I worked with her that she should have waited at that time till I got all my proper work set up to proceed in this area. And then I would have let her know that everything is safe  to go in the area to work. But at that present time, she didn't give me the opportunity to fulfill my obligation as being the barge   foreman,  and I know my responsibilities.</p></bodyText></excerpt>(Tr. <page number="16" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> 48-49.)</p><p>The Barge   Foreman  initially stated he was waiting until the barge  was upriver to set up the ladder  and that he was outside the barge  and Employee B was inside the barge,  near the stern, when Employee A climbed  down the steps formed by the cargo  ("I was going to go and set the ladder  further upriver." (Tr. 47.); "At that moment, I wasn't going to even allow those workers to get in that area without--they were going to be upriver." (Tr. 53.)). But the Barge   Foreman  abruptly changed his story when asked if he was in the process of getting the ladder  when the accident occurred. He stated that he "was proceeding to go get" the ladder  with the help of Employee B at the time Employee A climbed  down the cargo.  "The young lady,  she's not handy with the ladder.  Me and [Employee B] we two men, we proceed to hook the ladder  up, you know, and we carry it up and she had to reach up the ladder. " (Tr. 88-89.)

Despite the Barge   Foreman's  obfuscations regarding when he was "proceeding to go get" the ladder  and the locations where the ladders  were kept (as opposed to set up for actual use), the record is clear that he had not yet set up a ladder  to provide access to and from the barge  hold at the time of Employee A's death (Q. "So that morning,  you had not yet fulfilled your responsibility of putting a ladder  in the barge,  is that correct?"; Barge   Foreman:  "Correct." (Tr. 48.)).

A little later in his testimony, the Barge   Foreman  finally acknowledged not only is it permissible for employees to step on the bags,  it is "a necessary part of the employees' job duties." "I mean, if you're stacking bags,  I mean, quite naturally, I mean, you<page number="21" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> don't have an elevator or somebody to pick you up and make you unhook the bag.  I mean, yeah, they have to get up on the bags  to unhook the straps." (Tr. 70.)</p><p>In contrast, the Shift Supervisor  readily acknowledged that there are times "when the cargo  is stacked  sufficiently high that the cargo  can be used as steps" to access the hold. He stated he had personally used steps formed by cargo  to access the hold and had observed other employees doing the same (Tr. 109). In fact, the Shift Supervisor  testified, "Every day we work a bag   ship,  I'm aware that a majority of employees will be walking on cargo  at some point that day." (Tr. 139.)</p><p>When asked how he knows when it is safe  to use cargo  as steps to access the hold, the Shift Supervisor  replied it was a judgment call for each employee, not a determination made by a supervisor  prior to employees' use of the cargo  steps (Tr. 110). "[Y]our judgment comes into play when you look at that cargo  and decide whether or not you could climb down  these bags  or, you know, which bags  you could safely climb down. " (Tr. 111.)</p><p>Over the Secretary's objection, the Court qualified CTS's witness John Faulk as an expert in marine cargo  handling (Tr. 243). <page number="22" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/><footnote><anchor id="fnote7_92_1849_66"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p> The Secretary objected to Mr. Faulk's testimony at the hearing and again noted in its brief CTS "failed to timely designate Mr. Faulk as a testifying expert witness and failed to timely produce a CV or report from Mr. Faulk."(Secretary's brief, p. 3.) The Court overruled Secretary's objection (Tr. 243). The Secretary suggested in its brief CTS made misrepresentations regarding its relationship with Mr. Faulk at the hearing. Given CTS's minimal reliance on Mr. Faulk's testimony as well as the Court's assessment it does not support CTS's defense, the Court finds the Secretary was not prejudiced by the admission of Mr. Faulk's testimony and will not revisit the Secretary's objection to it.</p></bodyText></footnote> Faulk stated it is "very common" for employees to use stepped cargo  to access barge  holds (Tr. 246). "I've seen it hundreds of times done safely on various types of cargo.  And it's a practice that's been recognized by management and labor and OSHA since 1971." (Tr. 246.)</p><p>The Crane Operator has worked for CTS for 10 to 12 years (Tr. 23). His testimony (in contrast to that of the Shift Supervisor  and the Barge   Foreman)  was straightforward, responsive to the questions asked, and without<page number="23" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> artifice. The Court finds him a credible witness whose testimony is given great weight. The Crane Operator stated CTS has a 20-foot ladder  that it usually sets up to access the hold of the barge.  He estimated employees use the ladder  to access the hold 80 to 90 percent of the time, but he also observed employees routinely climb  the cargo   stacked  in the hold, "using it like a stepladder." (Tr. 24.) He typically stacks cargo  in a stair step manner for employees to use as access (Tr. 34).</p><p>The Crane Operator matter-of-factly stated Employee B entered the hold by climbing  down the stacked   sacks  because the ladder  had not been set up. <citation type="regulation" id="I5GCMCV92N1R7300P0000400" normalizedCite="29 C.F.R. 1918.24"><content><span normalizedCite="29 C.F.R. 1918.24">Section 1918.24(e)(1)<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#14829#571#000029#000001918 #                           24 #"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation> requires the employer to furnish a ladder  or equivalent safe  access "[w]here access to or from a stowed  deckload or other cargo  is needed."

(Tr. 46.) The Barge   Foreman  was asked whose responsibility it was to determine whether the steps formed by the cargo  were safe  to use to access the hold. He first responded, "Well, no one was told to go in the barge,  period, you know, because I was going to go and set the ladder  further upriver. So I mean, I didn't give the instructions for no one to get in the barge. " (Tr. 47.) When pressed to answer the question posed, the Barge   Foreman  stated, "Well, <page number="25" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> when I come on, that probably would have been my responsibility, you know, but what I was going to do is I was going to put the ladder  in and we was going to start on the floor." (Tr. 47.)</p><p>Had he gotten around to making a determination of whether the cargo  was safe  to use as steps, the Barge   Foreman  testified he would have made it "[b]y looking at it at the present time, you know. I would have made my determination of what to move and what not to move, and whether to even be in that area or not. I would have avoided that area, period, till it was corrected." (Tr. 54.) He stated he had made such determinations before.<excerpt><bodyText><p>Q.

And that's the reason why it's very important that the ladder  be set up for you to enter the barge  properly. She did it enter it, but it was unproperly done." (Tr. 51.) Elsewhere in his testimony, the Barge   Foreman  conceded Employee B had accessed the barge  hold before Employee A. When asked how Employee B accessed the hold, he stated,<excerpt><bodyText><p>How [Employee B] got in the barge,  they had steps that he <emphasis typeStyle="it">might</emphasis> have climbed  down, you know, <emphasis typeStyle="it">in the center that it was safe  for him to go down</emphasis>.

The Shift Supervisor  and the Crane Operator did not testify one way or the other regarding whether the Barge   Foreman  gave permission  to the laborers  to enter the barge  hold. Employee A is deceased and Employee B's written statement is silent on this issue. Thus, the only evidence in the record indicating the Barge   Foreman  had not yet given permission  to Employees A and B to enter the hold is the testimony of the Barge   Foreman.  The Court, having closely observed the Barge   Foreman's  demeanor and listened to his sworn testimony, finds his manner was evasive and defensive, and his testimony self-serving. His testimony is replete with contradictory statements and implausible scenarios. The Court quoted some of his self-contradictory testimony above regarding CTS's supposed prohibition against stepping on the cargo  and his muddled account of when he was planning to set up the ladder.  The Barge   Foreman  showed himself to be a fabulist, tailoring his answers to continually shift blame to Employee A, regardless of the disparities these answers created with his previous statements.</p><p>The Barge Foreman  admitted<page number="30" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> it was his responsibility to set up the ladder  accessing the barge  hold and to determine whether the stacked cargo  was safe  to use as steps, and he did neither. He stated he had worked with Employee A three days previous to her death and "[s]he complied with every last one of my commands, you know, with the 'do's and with the 'don'ts.'" (Tr. 84.) The Court determines the Barge Foreman  is not a credible witness on the issue of whether he gave the laborers permission  to enter the hold. The Court views his self-serving testimony as an attempt to divert responsibility for the unsafe conditions in the barge  hold to Employee A. The Barge Foreman's  repeated statements that he had not given the laborers permission  to enter the barge  hold are accorded no weight. <footnote><anchor id="fnote9_125_2544_33"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>CTS devotes a section of its brief to attacking the credibility of Employee B's written statements, admitted as Exhibit C-14.

The Court admitted the statements over CTS's objection (Tr. 204). Although the Court disagrees with CTS's assessment that the statements "have no indicia of reliability," (CTS's brief, p. 14) the Court agrees some of Employee B's answers are ambiguous and should be subject to cross-examination.

CTS's focus is misplaced. The violative  conduct here is not the entry of the employees into the hold--it is the failure of the Barge   Foreman  to "demonstrate[] that the nature of the cargo  and the type of stowage provides equivalent safe  access."

The Shift Supervisor  testified "Every day we work a bag ship,  I'm aware that a majority of employees will be walking on cargo  at some point that day." (Tr. 139.) The phrasing of the Crane Operator indicates it was routine and expected that employees would climb down  the<page number="32" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/>cargo  when hooking the hatch covers, the specific task the Barge Foreman  assigned the laborers  to perform that morning:  "<emphasis typeStyle="it">According to how we stack covers</emphasis>, [Employee B] gets in the barge,  and <emphasis typeStyle="it">he walks down the sacks </emphasis>." (Tr. 27.) <footnote><anchor id="fnote11_129_2670_17"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p> An experienced longshore man not involved in the accident (called to testify by CTS) also stated he has used cargo  to access barges  (Tr. 214).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>The Barge Foreman  was aware he had not set up the ladder  to access the<page number="33" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/>barge  hold because he planned to place it upriver. Therefore, he was aware the only method available to the employees to access the barge  hold was to climb down  the steps formed by the cargo.  The fact that the sacks  were stacked  in stair-step fashion suggests CTS intended the cargo  to be used as steps; otherwise, CTS could have stacked  each of the rows of sacks  six high. The Barge Foreman  was also aware he had not determined the stacked cargo  provided safe  access to the hold. He stated the cargo  was not safe  to step on at the time of Employee A's death (Tr. 54). Based on the record, the Court rejects CTS's contention it had no reason to suspect its employees would use the cargo  as steps to access the hold. On the contrary, the record establishes the employees' use of the cargo  as steps was routine and expected, especially given the Barge Foreman  had not placed the ladder  for access to the hold. <footnote><anchor id="fnote12_136_2786_29"/><label>12</label><bodyText><p> John Faulk, CTS's expert in marine cargo  handling, appeared to ignore the employer's obligation to demonstrate the cargo  steps provide safe  access as required by <citation type="regulation" id="I5GCMCV92N1R7300T0000400" normalizedCite="29 C.F.R. 1918.24"><content><span normalizedCite="29 C.F.R. 1918.24">§ 1918.24(e)(1)<locator><locatorKey><keyName name="citeReference"/><keyValue value="#14829#571#000029#000001918 #                           24 #"/></locatorKey></locator></span></content></citation>.

The superintendent should know the workplace, equipment, operations, and personnel under their direction.

The Shift Supervisor  stated he was aware "there was a rule in place that a ladder  was always to be present for safe  access" to the barge  hold (Tr. 107). He testified, "I can generally see the ladder  from the deck  of the ship  and that will be part of my inspection,  so to speak. . . . If I don't see one, I will ask the operator if I'm not seeing it and it's there or if someone is not using it." (Tr. 129.) When asked, "Whose job is it to ensure that the barge   foreman  timely sets up a ladder  for the longshoreman's use?," the Shift Superintendent replied, "Mine." (Tr. 131.)</p><p>As noted above, the Shift Supervisor  spent much of the time during his examination attempting to parry counsel for the Secretary's<page number="36" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> questions regarding the ladder.  Initially he stated the ladder  could not be set up at the start of the shift because the hatch covers were still in place. He stated, "[T]he accident happened right after we shifted covers." (Tr. 132). Immediately thereafter, however, the Shift Supervisor  stated, "That being said, I was not there watching the covers be shifted, so I couldn't tell you if the ladder  was already in the barge  or on its way to the barge  or laying next to the barge  when she actually went over the coaming." (Tr. 132-133). He then stated, "I'm pretty sure when I walked by that morning,  when the covers were in their original arrangement, there had been a ladder  used." (Tr. 133). CTS now acknowledges a ladder  was never in place for access to the hold the morning  of November 18, 2013.</p><p>Reasonable diligence includes the "obligation to inspect  the work area, to anticipate hazards  to which employees may be exposed, and to take measures to prevent the occurrence." Here, despite CTS's written safety program encouraging "[c]ontinuous inspections  of cargo  handling operations," the Shift Supervisor  failed to inspect  the work area of the barge  hold for the ladder.  Due to his failure<page number="37" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> to ensure the ladder  was in place, he failed to anticipate the logical consequence of its absence, that the employees tasked with working around the cargo  would use the stacked   sacks  to access the hold. His failure to inspect  the work area and to anticipate hazards  to which employees may be exposed set up his failure to take measures to prevent the occurrence of the hazardous condition, such as instructing the Barge   Foreman  to set up the ladder  or inspect  the stacked   cargo  to see if it was safe  to use as steps.</p><p>The absence of the ladder  and the presence of the stacked   cargo  were open and obvious conditions. The Shift Supervisor  stated he had walked past the barge  hold and inspected it the morning  of November 18 (Tr. 133).<excerpt><bodyText><p>[T]he conspicuous location, the readily observable nature of the violative  condition, and the presence of [the employer's] crews in the area warrant a finding of constructive knowledge.

The Court determines the Secretary has done so.</p><p>CTS's written safety program includes this rule: "To enter or exit a barge  hopper or ship  hold a ladder  must be used." (Exh. R-9, p. 5.) It has no written rule prohibiting the use of cargo  as steps to access the hold of a barge  or requiring a supervisor  to demonstrate the cargo  is safe  for such access. CTS does have, however, written rules prohibiting employees from stepping or climbing  on other surfaces and equipment ("Do not step on manhole covers."; "Never stand on covers being lifted or rolled."; "Employees are not to walk on<page number="42" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> the coamings of barges  at any time."; "Climbing  on buckets is prohibited." (Exh. C-5)). As discussed above, employees routinely used the cargo  to access barge  holds and CTS's supervisors  were aware of this use (Tr. 61-62, 70, 109, 139). The Shift Supervisor  agreed</p><p>CTS's rule requiring employees to enter and exit a barge  hold using only a ladder  "is incomplete." (Tr. 119.) The record establishes CTS's written rule stating a ladder  must be used to enter or exit a barge  hopper is not absolute and is ignored regularly by management and employees. CTS failed to train its employees to use only a ladder  to access the barge  hold. The Crane Operator was unaware whether there was a "mandatory work rule  at Cooper which says you must use a ladder  and you are prohibited from climbing  on cargo. " (Tr. 28.) Neither the Barge   Foreman  nor the Shift Supervisor  was aware of a rule prohibiting employees from using cargo  as steps (Tr. 60, 109). The Shift Supervisor  also testified it was up to the individual employees to "decide whether or not you could climb down  these bags,  or you know, which bags  you could safely climb down. " (Tr. 111.)</p><p>Although its employees routinely used the cargo  as access to the<page number="43" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/>  barge  hold rather than a ladder,  there is no evidence CTS ever disciplined any of its employees for this purported infraction. Exhibit R-12 comprises disciplinary records produced by CTS. None of them was issued for using cargo  to access a barge  hold or for failing to use a ladder  to access a barge  hold. According to the Barge   Foreman,  both Employee A and Employee B violated company policy when they entered the barge  hold without his permission.  When asked if he disciplined Employee B for his part in the misconduct,  the Barge   Foreman  wove an implausible tale.<excerpt><bodyText><p>Q. Okay. Is it true that you did not discipline [Employee B] in any way for climbing  down the sacks  like steps on that morning? </p><p>Barge  Foreman:  Yes, sir, I told him, you know, that ain't the proper way to go. "Hey, man, I do this. This is what I've always done." I said, "Hey, that's not the proper way."</p><p>Q. But is it true that you did not discipline [Employee B] in any way for climbing  down the sacks  like steps that morning  with you; is that true?</p><p>Barge  Foreman:  Yes. No, we -- like I said, I gave him a lecture. I mean, I don't know, lecture, discipline.

When you saw [Employee B] climb down  the sacks  like steps on that morning  before you had an opportunity to put the ladder  in, you did not report or discipline him in any way; is that correct?</p><p>Barge  Foreman:  I didn't get around to it, letting the supervisor  know, because everything took place so fast. But yeah, I did let him know personally that that wasn't the correct way to go. . . . When I come around, he come hollering. You know, he was hollering and I come back around and I said, "Man, what's going on?" He said, "The lady, the bags  done fell on her." I said, "What you doing down in the barge? " "I climbed  in." "You know that ain't the proper way, man. Why you done that?" I mean, that was it. You know, I mean, I didn't see. I didn't see [Employee B] get in the barge  or the young lady,  you know.</p><p>Q. You're telling the Court now that you had a conversation with [Employee B] about how it was improper for him to get in the barge  the way he did?</p><p>Barge  Foreman:  Yeah, after I saw him in the barge,  yes, sir.</p><p>Q. And where was [Employee A] at this time?</p><p>Barge   Foreman:  At the present time, that's when the lady --the bags  must have fell on<page number="45" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> her. When I come along, you know, and I saw all this here, you know, I said, "What's going on?" They climbed  in the barge.  "Well, she got in the barge  and the bags  fell on her." You know, I said, "Why? You know, I'm supposed to put the ladder  up."</p></bodyText></excerpt>(Tr. 55-60).</p><p>The Court is skeptical that anyone would, upon being notified a subordinate employee was lying crushed beneath cargo,  choose that moment to upbraid another employee. Employee B's account of the frantic events immediately following Employee A's accident also casts doubt on the Barge   Foreman's  version ("I hollered for anybody. I went to see if she was breathing but she wasn't responding so I climbed  the sacks  to get out of the barge.  I got the attention of a guy on the ship;  he got the attention of the crane operator. Then guys working on the deck  of the dock came on the barge  and we started moving sacks  from around her so we could get to her." (Exh. C-14.)).</p><p>The Secretary has established CTS did not have safety rules prohibiting its employees from using cargo  to enter or exit barge  holds or requiring supervisors  to demonstrate the cargo  was safe  to use as access before permitting employees to use it. CTS did not provide<page number="46" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> safety training requiring its employees to access barge  holds using ladders  only or prohibiting them from using cargo  to access barge  holds until a supervisor  demonstrated the cargo  was safe  to use.

As noted above, CTS does not have a written rule requiring a supervisor's   permission  before entering a barge  hold--that written rule applies only to the hold of a ship.  The Shift Supervisor  testified, "[A]lthough this is referring to a ship  hold, I believe a reasonable person could say that entering a hopper, they would need to wait for a supervisor's   permission. " (Tr. 116.) The Court disagrees that the Shift Supervisor's  conclusion is the obvious one.

Up until the time of Employee A's accident, she and Employee B were exposed to the violative  condition the morning <page number="50" pageScheme="2015 OSAHRC LEXIS 38"/> of November 18. The Shift Supervisor  testified that immediately following Employee A's accident, he and other CTS and ship  employees, as well as rescue personnel, used the stacked   cargo  to access the hold in order to help Employee A (Tr. 159). When asked how they accessed the hold of the barge,  the Shift Supervisor  stated, "Everyone that I saw gained access by climbing  down the cargo. " (Tr. 159.) The Shift Supervisor  testified employees have been previously injured while walking on cargo  (Tr. 139). Mr. Faulk testified a passing ship,  currents, or high winds could cause cargo  to dislodge (Tr. 247-48). Therefore, the likelihood of injuries resulting from use of unsafe cargo  to access a barge  is high. Potential injuries could be severe, as demonstrated by the accident.
