The Licensee  shall also furnish to said representative such further information as he may require concerning the construction, operation, and maintenance of the project, and of any alteration thereof, and shall notify him of the date upon which work will begin, as far in advance thereof as said representative may reasonably specify, and shall notify him promptly in writing of any suspension of work for a period of more than one<page number="96" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> week, and of its resumption and completion. The Licensee  shall allow said representative and other officers or employees of the United States, showing proper credentials, free and unrestricted access to, through, and across the project lands and project works in the performance of their official duties. The Licensee  shall comply with such rules and regulations  of general or special applicability as the Commission may prescribe from time to time for the protection of life, health, or property.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf"><emphasis typeStyle="un">Article 5</emphasis></emphasis>. The Licensee,  within five years from the date of issuance  of the license,  shall acquire title in fee or the right to use in perpetuity all lands, other than lands of the United States, necessary or appropriate for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the project. The Licensee  or its successors and assigns shall, during the period of the license,  retain the possession of all project property covered by the license  as issued or as later amended, including the project area, the project works, and all franchises, easements, water rights, and rights of occupancy  and use; and none of such properties shall be voluntarily sold, leased, transferred, abandoned, or otherwise<page number="97" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> disposed of without the prior written approval of the Commission, except that the Licensee  may lease or otherwise dispose of interests in project lands or property without specific written approval of the Commission pursuant to the then current regulations  of the Commission.

The Commission reserves the right, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to require such alterations in the number, character and locations of gages, meters, or other measuring devices, and the method of operation thereof, as are necessary to secure adequate determinations. The installation of gages, the rating of said stream or streams, and the determination of the flow thereof, shall be under the supervision of, or in cooperation with, the District Engineer  of the United States Geological Survey having charge of stream-gaging operations in the region of the project, and the Licensee  shall advance to the United States Geological Survey the amount of funds estimated to be necessary for such supervision, or cooperation<page number="100" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> for such periods as may be mutually agreed upon. The Licensee  shall keep accurate and sufficient records of the foregoing determinations to the satisfaction of the Commission, and shall make return of such records annually at such time and in such form as the Commission may prescribe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf"><emphasis typeStyle="un">Article 9</emphasis></emphasis>.

For benefits provided by a storage   reservoir  or other headwater improvement of the United States, the Licensee  shall pay to the Commission the amounts for which it is billed from time to time for such headwater benefits and for the cost of making the determinations pursuant to the then current regulations  of the Commission under the Federal Power Act.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf"><emphasis typeStyle="un">Article 12</emphasis></emphasis>. The operations of the Licensee,  so far as they affect the use, storage  and discharge from storage  of waters affected by the license,  shall at all times be controlled by such reasonable rules and regulations  as the Commission may prescribe for the protection of life, health, and property, and in the interest of the fullest practicable conservation and utilization of such waters for power purposes and for other beneficial public uses, including recreational  purposes, and the Licensee  shall release water from the project reservoir <page number="102" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> at such rate in cubic feet  per second, or such volume in acre-feet per specified period of time, as the Commission may prescribe for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf"><emphasis typeStyle="un">Article 13</emphasis></emphasis>.

An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared by Commission staff  and issued on June 7, 2013, analyzing the impacts<page number="3" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> of the proposed project and alternatives to it. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed comments on the EA. The comments and recommendations  have been fully considered in determining whether, and under what conditions, to issue this license. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">A. Existing Corps Facilities</emphasis></p><p>6. The Lake Shelbyville Project will use the existing Corps' Lake Shelbyville Dam,  which is owned and operated by the Corps and is not part of the licensed project. Lake Shelbyville Dam  is an earthen embankment with an elevation of 643 feet  above mean sea level (msl). The dam  is 3,025 feet  long and rises 108 feet  above the river bed. The dam  includes a concrete spillway  located at 593 feet  msl with three Tainter gates that are 45 feet  wide by 37 feet  high and two low-level regulating outlet  structures that release water through the face of the spillway.  The dam  provides a combined capacity of over 160,000 cubic feet  per second (cfs) at a maximum pool elevation of 638.2 feet  msl, and over 100,000 cfs at elevation 626.5 msl, the top of the flood control pool. The impoundment above Lake Shelbyville Dam  has a maximum storage  capacity of 684,000 acre-feet. The average<page number="4" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> depth of the reservoir  is 16 feet,  and the maximum is 67 feet. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">B. Current Corps Operation</emphasis></p><p>7. Lake Shelbyville Dam  is operated to control flooding in the Kaskaskia River Valley, reduce flood stages in the Mississippi River, supplement low flow for navigation in the middle and lower Mississippi River, and improve domestic and industrial water supply. Of the 684,000 acre-feet of storage  at Lake Shelbyville, 474,000 acre-feet have been designated for flood control.</p><p>8. The Corps operates Lake Shelbyville based on a guide curve for reservoir  surface elevations as follows: (1) December 15 to April 1 - elevation 594.0 feet  msl; (2) April 1 to May 1 - elevation 596.0 feet  msl; and (3) May 1 to December 15 - elevation 599.7 feet  msl. The dates have an allowable variance of plus or minus 14 days. When the Corps is not using Lake Shelbyville for flood control storage,  the elevations have a variance of plus or minus 0.5 foot except for the winter guide curve elevation of 594.0 feet  msl which is the targeted minimum level.</p><p>9. The Corps maintains a minimum flow of 10 cfs in the Kaskaskia River for water quality purposes which is measured at a United States Geological Survey<page number="5" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> gage located 700 feet  below the dam.  Between May 1 and November 1, the Corps releases a maximum of 1,800 cfs until the lake elevation reaches 610.0 feet  msl. When water levels are above the guide curve from November 1 through April 30, and when water levels are above 610.0 feet  msl in the May 1 through November 1 period, the Corps releases up to a maximum of 4,500 cfs to bring the elevation back down to its target for the period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">C. Proposed Project Facilities</emphasis></p><p>10. The Lake Shelbyville Project will use the existing Lake Shelbyville Dam,  intake structure, Tainter gates and outlet  structures that control outflow at the spillway,  along with the following new facilities: (1) a trashrack with 4-inch spacing integrated into the Corps' existing 9-foot-wide by 15-foot-tall west intake structure; (2) a steel liner installed in the Corps' existing west outlet  chamber; (3) a 13-foot-diameter bifurcation chamber <footnote><anchor id="fnote5_27_349_178"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p> The bifurcation chamber consists of a river release valve that allows flows to be passed three ways in order to match the outlet  capacity of the Corps' existing outlet  structure: (1) through the project penstock;  (2) through the river release valve into the stilling basin; or (3) a combination of both.</p></bodyText></footnote> and river release valve, which can be opened to pass excess flows into the stilling basin, installed at the existing west outlet  structure; (4) a 575-foot-long, 12-foot-diameter steel penstock  extending from the bifurcation chamber; (5) a 60-foot-long, 50-foot-wide, 68-foot-high<page number="6" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> concrete powerhouse  containing a 6.8-MW Kaplan turbine-generator; (6) an approximately 24.5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, 6.7-foot-tall draft tube; (7) a 105-foot-wide, 49-foot-long tailrace angled at a slope of 8 horizontal to 1 vertical; (8) a 12.47-kilovolt, 407-foot-long buried transmission line connecting the project to an existing Shelby Electric Cooperative substation located 900 feet  downstream of the dam;  (9) a four-foot by six-foot transformer pad located adjacent to the powerhouse;  (10) a 300-foot-long access road that would pass to the west of the powerhouse;  (11) a parking lot on the west side of the powerhouse;  and (12) appurtenant facilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">D. Project Boundary</emphasis></p><p>11. The project boundary<page number="7" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> encloses the intake, Tainter gates, outlet  structures, penstock,   powerhouse,  tailrace, transformer, and the 407 feet  of 12.47-kV buried transmission line. The project boundary encompasses a total of 3.24 acres, all of which are lands managed by the Corps. The Corps' dam  and reservoir  are not included in the project boundary.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">E. Proposed Project Operation</emphasis></p><p>12. Shelbyville Hydro proposes to operate the hydropower project in a run-of-release mode, utilizing releases from Lake Shelbyville as they are provided by the Corps. The project will generate when releases are between 130 cfs and 1,500 cfs. When releases are below 130 cfs or greater than 1,500 cfs, the flows will pass through the Corps' existing outlet  structures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">F. Proposed Measures</emphasis></p><p>13. To minimize soil erosion  and sedimentation associated with construction of the project, Shelbyville Hydro proposes a Soil Erosion  and Control Plan that includes measures for limiting grading and vehicle traffic, separating and stockpiling soil in excavation  and staging areas and isolating them from water sources, using silt fencing and straw berms, providing for safe fuel storage,  and conducting erosion  and turbidity monitoring. <page number="8" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/></p><p>14. To prevent contamination of the project site during construction and operation, Shelbyville Hydro proposes a Hazardous Substances Spill Prevention and Cleanup Plan, which includes provisions for site-specific oil and hazardous substances storage,  spill prevention, and cleanup.</p><p>15. To ensure project operation does not decrease dissolved oxygen (DO) levels downstream of the project, Shelbyville Hydro proposes a Dissolved Oxygen Monitoring  and Management Plan that includes installing a supplemental aeration system, monitoring  the efficacy of the aeration system over a five-month period, and monitoring  downstream DO for the term of the license. </p><p>16. To monitor and minimize the spread of zebra mussels, Shelbyville Hydro proposes a Zebra Mussel Monitoring  and Control Plan.</p><p>17. To protect fish  that may be trapped during construction of the cofferdam,  Shelbyville Hydro proposes to develop a cofferdam  fish  salvage plan.</p><p>18. To protect upstream migrating fish,  Shelbyville Hydro proposes to provide an analysis of the potential for blade strike, considering both the probable discharge velocity and the swimming speed of fish  that may be moving upstream in the spring, <page number="9" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> in a tailrace turbine strike evaluation report.</p><p>19. To mitigate the loss of vegetation during project construction, Shelbyville Hydro proposes a Revegetation Management Plan that includes provisions for reestablishing native plants in disturbed areas, and avoiding sensitive plants that occur within the project boundary during construction.</p><p>20. To minimize the spread of invasive plants, Shelbyville Hydro proposes a Noxious Weed Management Plan that includes measures for minimizing the establishment of invasive weed species in areas disturbed by project construction.</p><p>21. To mitigate impacts on recreation,  Shelbyville Hydro proposes a Construction Recreation  Plan that includes provisions for preventing public access to construction areas, minimizing the time that access to recreation  areas is restricted, and descriptions of any temporary facilities that will be used if permanent recreation  facilities (e.g., fishing steps) or access roads are closed.</p><p>22. Shelbyville Hydro proposes to cease all construction activities if archaeological resources are discovered during project construction, and consult with the Commission and Illinois State Historic Preservation Officer<page number="10" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> (Illinois SHPO) to determine appropriate treatment.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">SUMMARY OF LICENSE  REQUIREMENTS</emphasis></h><p>23. The license,  which authorizes 6.8 MW of renewable energy, includes Shelbyville Hydros proposed environmental measures as noted above and the following additional staff-recommended measures, some of which are modifications to Shelbyville Hydro's proposals.</p><p>24. To ensure that any adverse effects on water quality (e.g., turbidity due to erosion)  during project operation are identified, the license  requires a stream bank stability  monitoring  plan that includes a provision for a visual assessment of bank stability  in the project tailrace after one year of project operation. Monitoring  results will provide information necessary to distinguish bank erosion  resulting from altered flow patterns in the tailrace due to project operations.</p><p>25. To provide for DO compliance monitoring,  the license  requires Shelbyville Hydro to notify the Commission in the event that DO falls below the current state DO standards and to file a report including proposed, or agency recommended, corrective actions, as part of the dissolved oxygen monitoring  and management plan that includes.</p><p>26. To prevent<page number="11" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> the transport and establishment of noxious weeds during project construction and provide longer-term protection from weeds by establishing healthy-plant communities within the project area, the license  requires a noxious weed management plan with a provision to establish benchmarks for the percentage of noxious weed cover that will trigger the need for control measures.</p><p>27. To provide for public safety and ensure that recreational  access is being provided during project construction, the license  requires a construction recreation  plan with provisions for public safety, an implementation schedule that minimizes the time that access to recreation  areas is restricted, and descriptions of any temporary facilities that will be used if permanent recreation  facilities (e.g., fishing steps) or access roads are closed.</p><p>28. If a previously unidentified archaeological resource is discovered during project construction, operation, or maintenance, or other project-related activities, the license  requires Shelbyville Hydro to stop all land-clearing and land-disturbing activities and consult with the Illinois SHPO, the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, and the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma. <page number="12" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/></p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION</emphasis></h><p>29.

Illinois DNR filed no comments in response to the EA. Therefore, it is assumed the agency concurs with the plan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">C. Revegetation Management Plan</emphasis></p><p>59. U.S. EPA recommends that Shelbyville Hydro develop the final plant list for the Revegetation Management Plan in consultation  with the Illinois DNR and that the plan include "appropriate benchmarks for live plants (e.g., appropriate percentage of native shrubs and/or grasses per acre or number of live stems per acre)."</p><p>60. The Revegetation Management Plan includes the development of a landscape plan in consultation  with the Corps prior to ground-disturbing activities that would incorporate local, native shrubs and grasses in plantings, as recommended by U.S. EPA. The Revegetation Management Plan also includes a semi-annual compliance monitoring  program to evaluate the success of the revegetation efforts, a filing schedule for annual   monitoring  reports, and a description of the procedures to be followed if<page number="30" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/>  monitoring  indicates that revegetation is not successful. Annual   monitoring  reports will be provided to the Commission, the Corps, and Illinois DNR for review. With these measures already included in the Revegetation Management Plan (Article 407), U.S. EPA's recommendations  to consult with Illinois DNR and include benchmarks for live plants are not necessary.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">D. Air Quality</emphasis></p><p>61. U.S. EPA recommends the inclusion of appropriate diesel emission best management practices (BMPs), such as regular maintenance on diesel engines, specifications  for proper diesel storage  and fueling equipment, and other similar measures, in the terms of the license  to reduce diesel emissions from construction equipment and to minimize construction impacts to air quality. However, the Hazardous Substances Spill Prevention and Cleanup Plan (Article 403) already includes measures for proper diesel storage  and containment and provides for training of contractors and construction personnel in regards to proper storage  and fueling of construction-related vehicles. In addition, the Construction Recreation  Plan (Article 409) also already includes measures for the proper use and maintenance of construction-related<page number="31" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> vehicles. Therefore, since these plans will sufficiently minimize impacts to air quality resulting from project construction, U.S. EPA's recommendation  to include diesel emission BMPs is not needed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">E. Public Outreach</emphasis></p><p>62. U.S. EPA recommends that the Commission and the Corps "reach out to users (i.e., post a notice of construction on agency websites and a local website(s) for Kaskaskia River recreational  opportunities, if one exists, in addition to other forms of notification)." It also recommends that the Commission inform recreation  users with signage explaining the timing of construction, the different phases of construction, an explanation of project benefits, and the proposed final appearance of the project site.</p><p>63. The revised Construction Recreation  Plan (Article 409) will assist in minimizing disruptions to recreation  facilities and access, and will protect the public's safety in the project area during construction. To inform and protect the public, the plan contains measures to control traffic, and requires the placement of informative signage, screens and fencing around construction areas, and a line of buoys to restrict boating access in the tailwater<page number="32" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> area. The plan also requires the restriction of access to certain areas that could pose a danger to public safety, and it also includes additional measures that will ensure public safety and adequate access during construction and restoration, as well as mitigation for the effects of construction and operation on recreational  resources in the project area. Because the revised Construction Recreation  Plan will adequately inform and protect the public, U.S. EPA's recommendation  for additional public outreach is not adopted.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">A.

The basic purpose<page number="42" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> of the Commission's economic analysis is to provide a general estimate of the potential power benefits and the costs of a project, and of reasonable alternatives to project power. The estimate helps to support an informed decision concerning what is in the public interest with respect to a proposed license. </p><p>84. In applying this analysis to the Lake Shelbyville Project, three options have been considered: no action, Shelbyville Hydro's proposal, and the project as licensed herein. Under the no action alternative, the project would not be built. As proposed by Shelbyville Hydro, the levelized annual  cost of constructing and operating the Lake Shelbyville Project is $ 2,697,760, or $ 132.89/megawatt-hour (MWh). The proposed project would generate an average of 20,300/MWh of energy annually.

Therefore, <page number="44" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> in the first year of operation, project power would cost $ 887,844, or $ 43.74/MWh, more than the likely cost of alternative power.</p><p>86. In considering public interest factors, the Commission takes into account that hydroelectric projects offer unique operational benefits to the electric utility system (ancillary service benefits). These benefits include the ability to help maintain the stability  of a power system, such as by quickly adjusting power output to respond to rapid changes in system load; and to respond rapidly to a major utility system or regional blackout by providing a source of power to help restart fossil-fuel based generating stations and put them back online.</p><p>87. Although this analysis shows that the project as licensed herein would cost more to operate than our estimated cost of alternative power, it is the applicant who must decide whether to accept this license  and any financial risk that entails.</p><p>88. Although staff  does not explicitly account for the effects inflation may have on the future cost of electricity, the fact that hydropower generation is relatively insensitive to inflation compared to fossil-fueled generators is an important economic<page number="45" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> consideration for power producers and the consumers they serve. This is one reason project economics is only one of the many public interest factors the Commission considers in determining whether or not, and under what conditions, to issue a license. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT</emphasis></h><p>89.

The EA for the project contains background information, analysis of effects, and support for related license  articles. Based on the record of this proceeding, including the EA and the comments thereon, licensing the Lake Shelbyville Project as described in this order would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The project will be safe if operated and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this license. </p><p>91. Based on an independent review and evaluation of the project, recommendations  from the resource agencies and other stakeholders, and the no-action alternative, as documented in the EA, I have selected the proposed Lake Shelbyville Project, with the staff-recommended measures, and find that it is best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing the Kaskaskia River.</p><p>92. This alternative was selected because: (1) issuance  of an original license  will serve to provide a beneficial and dependable source of electric energy; (2) the required environmental measures will protect and enhance fish  and wildlife  resources, water quality, recreational  resources, and historic properties; and<page number="47" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> (3) the 6.8 MW of electric capacity comes from a renewable resource that does not contribute to atmospheric pollution.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle="bf">LICENSE  TERM</emphasis></h><p>93.

The project boundaries may be changed to exclude land conveyed under this article only upon approval of revised Exhibit G drawings  (project boundary maps) reflecting exclusion of that land. Lands conveyed under this article will be excluded from the project only upon a determination that the lands are not necessary for project purposes, <page number="91" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 623"/> such as operation and maintenance, flowage, recreation,  public access, protection of environmental resources, and shoreline control, including shoreline aesthetic values. Absent extraordinary circumstances, proposals to exclude lands conveyed under this article from the project shall be consolidated for consideration when revised Exhibit G drawings  would be filed for approval for other purposes.</p><p>(g) The authority granted to the licensee  under this article shall not apply to any part of the public lands and reservations of the United States included within the project boundary.</p><p>(E) The licensee  shall serve copies of any Commission filing required by this order on any entity specified in the order to be consulted on matters relating to that filing.

Equitrans' mainline system is located in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania. Equitrans provides open-access transportation service, including to local distribution companies serving the city of Pittsburgh and surrounding areas.</p><p>In 2003, Equitrans acquired, by merger with its affiliate Carnegie Interstate Pipeline  Company (CIPCO), gathering  and transmission  facilities located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_10_132_86"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p><citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C14FJ22D6MX80020000400"><content>Equitrans, L.P., <span normalizedCite="104 F.E.R.C.

The M-90 pipeline  is a 15.69-mile  2 to 10-inch diameter low pressure pipeline  with a maximum allowable operating pressure of 40 pounds per square inch atmosphere (psia) that flows gas west from Equitrans' M-35 pipeline  to its M-44 pipeline  in the east. Since the 2003 purchase of these facilities, the valve  at the interconnection, between the M-90 and M-35 pipelines,  was closed and has remained closed throughout Equitrans' ownership. Equitrans proposes to cap the facilities just west of its 1997 Hardman Meter and the<page number="3" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 624"/> west end of the M-90 pipeline  where the valve  is closed. The gas being delivered into the M-90 pipeline  from the 1997 Hardman Meter will continue to flow east on the active section of the M-90 pipeline  to its ultimate market.</p><p>Currently, there is a single meter receiving approximately 12 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per day of locally produced natural gas  flowing from Equitrans' 1841 Osborne Allen Receipt Point Meter through its PEBC1841 gathering  pipeline  to the M-90 pipeline  facilities, which then flows east to its ultimate market. Equitrans has been in contact with the producer  and plans are underway to tap into Equitrans' H-10 pipeline  and move the 1841 Osborne Allen Receipt Point Meter prior to the proposed abandonment  in order to minimize disruption of the producer's  gas volumes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">Notice and Interventions</emphasis></p><p>Notice of the application was published in the <emphasis typeStyle="it">Federal Register</emphasis> on February 12, 2014 (<citation type="case" id="I5C14FJ22D6MX800C0000400"><content><span normalizedCite="79 FR 14022">79 Fed.
