On December 5, 2013, Jersey Central Power and Light Company and PSEG Fossil, LLC, licensees  for the Yards Creek Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Project, filed a Minimum Flow Compliance Monitoring  Plan pursuant to Article 402 of the project license.  The project is located on Yards Creek, in the townships of Hardwick and Blairstown, Warren County, New Jersey.</p><p>LICENSE  REQUIREMENTS</p><p>2. Article 402 of the project license  <footnote><anchor id="fnote1_10_101_17"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p> Order Issuing New License,  issued May 9, 2013 (<citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C0NRT51XJJ2Y0020000400"><content><span normalizedCite="143 F.E.R.C.

Article 401 requires the licensees  to release a minimum flow of 0.875 cubic feet per second (cfs) from the pumped storage project's lower reservoir  into Yards Creek for the protection of fish and wildlife  resources, aesthetic resources, and water quality.  The Article 402 compliance monitoring  plan is to include a detailed description of how the minimum flow will be calculated and include a protocol for reporting  deviations.  The plan is to be<page number="2" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> developed in consultation  with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (New Jersey DEP) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service (FWS). The plan is to include: (1) an implementation schedule; (2) documentation of consultation;  (3) copies of recommendations on the completed plan after it has been prepared and provided to the agencies; and (4) specific descriptions of how the agencies' comments are accommodated by the plan.</p><p>LICENSEES'  MINIMUM FLOW COMPLIANCE MONITORING  PLAN</p><p>3. In their filing, the licensees  explain that the project releases flows to Yards Creek using a spillway,  two 30-inch Howell-Bunger valves,  and two smaller  valves  at the project's lower reservoir  dam. The spillway  and the 30-inch valves  are generally used only to release storm-related high flows. The smaller  valves,  a 12-inch butterfly valve  and an 8-inch butterfly valve,  would normally be used for minimum flow releases. The licensees <page number="3" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> maintain continuous minimum flow releases under normal, non-spill conditions using the two smaller  valves,  which are operated manually or automatically, with release rates changing in response to project operation and the elevation  of the lower reservoir.  The two valves  are operated to release the 0.875- cfs minimum flow when the lower reservoir  is at its normal minimum elevation. </p><p>4. Under the licensees'  compliance monitoring  plan, flow releases through the two smaller  valves  would be measured using magnetic flow monitors.  Data from these monitors  would be sent electronically to the project powerhouse and recorded  at 10-minute  intervals. When the project is passing high flows using the 30-inch valves,  the project operators would manually record the use of the valves  and the valve  positions, in addition to the automated recording  of flows through the two smaller  valves.  Also, the licensees  note that flows in Yards Creek are recorded  at a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow  gage  No. 01143900 located 1.4 miles downstream  of the lower reservoir.  That gage  records data at 15-minute  intervals, and is funded by the licensees  and maintained by the USGS.</p><p>5. The licensees  would<page number="4" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> maintain the data collected  from the magnetic flow monitors,  and data collected  at the USGS gage,  in the project operating system, and maintain manual records of operation of the 30-inch valves  outside of periods when the 8-inch or 12-inch valves  are not in use.</p><p>6. An alarm would be maintained in the project powerhouse to alert the project operators if flows through the two smaller  valves  fall below the required minimum. The licensees  indicate that short term, infrequent inconsistencies, such as instrument malfunction  or debris clogging, may occur that would lead to indications of low flows, and that response time to such events should be less than 4 hours. During such an event, one of the other release valves  would be opened to maintain minimum flow releases if necessary.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Reporting </emphasis></p><p>7. Under the licensees'  compliance monitoring  plan, low-flow  measurements  would not be considered deviations  from the minimum flow requirements unless the following conditions are met, and there is no flow released from the spillway  or the 30-inch valves:  (1) records from the downstream  USGS gage  show values less than 0.875 cfs, and (2) the duration  of low-flow  measurements  exceed 24<page number="5" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> hours. The licensees  indicate that, should they identify such a deviation  at any point during the year, they would file a report with the Commission within 15 days, to include a complete description of the deviation,  including its duration,  and an explanation of the actions taken to remedy the situation. Finally, the licensees  indicate that, should emergency  conditions occur at the project that prevent them from fulfilling the minimum flow obligations they set forth in the plan, they would notify the Commission within 24 hours and provide a report to the Commission within 15 days from the date of the emergency. </p><p>8. Annually, by March 1 of each year, the licensees  would submit an annual report  of minimum flow compliance to the Commission and the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife  (New Jersey DFW). <footnote><anchor id="fnote2_19_439_26"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p> The New Jersey DFW is a division of the New Jersey DEP.</p></bodyText></footnote> The annual  reports would contain, at minimum, the daily minimum flow as measured by the 8-inch and 12-inch valves  for each day in the previous calendar year in tabular format. Additionally, for any periods in which the recorded  minimum flow values are below the minimum flow requirement, the licensees  would include the following: (1) the duration,  in hours, of the low-flow  measurement, <page number="6" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> including the start and end time; (2) the steps taken in response to the low-flow  measurement;  (3) the minimum elevation  of the lower reservoir  during the low-flow  measurement  period; (4) whether the spillway  was operating; (5) whether the 30-inch valves  were open; (6) flow data collected  at the downstream  USGS gage,  and (7) measures taken to remedy low-flow  measurements,  if applicable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">Schedule</emphasis></p><p>9. The licensees  state in the compliance monitoring  plan that they are currently providing the 0.875-cfs minimum flow pursuant to Article 401, and that the alarm system and flow data recording  will be integrated into the project data management in the first quarter of 2014. The licensees  indicate that they will begin following the compliance monitoring  plan, including data recording  and reporting,  on April 1, 2014, and will provide the first annual report  pursuant to the plan on March 1, 2015.</p><p>CONSULTATION </p><p>10. The licensees  provided a draft<page number="7" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> of the compliance monitoring  plan to the New Jersey DFW and FWS via email on October 8, 2013. Comments supplied by the New Jersey DFW on November 26, 2013 were incorporated into the final plan as filed with the Commission. The FWS did not provide any comments on the plan.</p><p>DISCUSSION</p><p>11. The licensees'  compliance monitoring  plan provides for monitoring,  documenting, and reporting  compliance with the minimum flow requirements of license  Article 401, and incorporates comments provided by the consulted agencies.</p><p>12. However, we disagree with the criteria that the licensees  would use under the compliance monitoring  plan to identify deviations  from the minimum release requirements of Article 401. Minimum flow deficiencies lasting as long as 24 hours have the potential to harm fish and wildlife  resources, aesthetic resources, and water quality,  which the Article 401 flow release requirement is intended to protect. We note that Article 401 contains a clause that the required minimum flow may be temporarily modified  if required by operating emergencies  beyond the control of the licensees,  and for short periods upon agreement between the licensees,  the New Jersey DEP, and the<page number="8" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> FWS. We expect the licensees  to comply with the Article 401 minimum flow release requirement at all times outside of such operating emergencies  and agreed-upon short periods. Recorded  deviations  from the requirements of Article 401 need to be reported the Commission in a timely manner so that the Commission can determine if Article 401 has been violated, and whether further actions are necessary to avoid future deviations. </p><p>13. Based on the discussion above, the licensees'  compliance monitoring  plan should be modified  to require the licensees  to file a minimum flow deviation  report with the Commission within 15 days of any instance in which: (1) no flows are released from the spillway  or the 30-inch valves,  (2) records from the downstream  USGS streamflow  gage  No. 01143900 show 15-minute  values less than 0.875 cfs, and (3) the low-flow  measurement  is determined to not be the result of a monitoring  malfunction.  Any reports of such deviations  filed with the Commission should include records of the releases made through the 8-inch and 12-inch valves  for the period in question, because they are normally used for minimum flow releases. The reports should also describe any environmental<page number="9" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> impacts caused by the deviation.  We encourage the licensees  to operate the project's flow release equipment so that flows of at least 0.875 cfs are released at the minimum elevation  of the lower reservoir. </p><p>14. In its annual  minimum flow compliance reports, the licensees  should identify any deviations  that meet the criteria above that occur within the annual  reporting  periods, and the dates on which such deviations  were reported to the Commission. The first annual report,  to be filed by March 1, 2015, should also identify any deviations  that occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2014.</p><p>15. The licensees'  compliance monitoring  plan, filed December 5, 2013 pursuant to license  Article 402, with the modification described above, would ensure that the licensees  comply with the minimum flow requirement of license  Article 401, and should be approved.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">The Director orders</emphasis>:</p><p>(A) The Minimum Flow Compliance Monitoring  Plan filed by Jersey Central Power and Light Company and PSEG Fossil, LLC (licensees)  on December 5, 2013, pursuant to Article 402 of the Yards Creek Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Project, is approved, as modified  in paragraphs (B) and (C) below.</p><p>(B) The licensees <page number="10" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 599"/> shall file a minimum flow deviation  report, to include the information identified in its December 5, 2013 Minimum Flow Compliance Monitoring  Plan, with the Commission within 15 days of any instance in which: (1) no flows are released from the project's spillway  or 30-inch valves,  (2) records from the downstream  U.S. Geological Survey streamflow   gage  No. 01143900 show 15-minute  values less than 0.875 cubic feet per second, and (3) the low-flow   measurement  is determined to not be the result of a monitoring   malfunction.

The Shoshone Falls Project broadly consists of four dam  sections, an intake  structure, a power tunnel, a steel<page number="2" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 600"/> penstock, and two adjacent powerhouses.  The river  channel  upstream of all dam  sections is split by an island that separates river  flows into north and south channels.  Flow in the north channel  feeds Dam  Nos. 1, 2, and 3, as well as the intake  structure. Flow in the south channel  feeds Dam  No. 4. In the order issued  July 1, 2010, the Commission approved a request by the licensee  to amend the project license.  That amendment includes replacing one of the project's powerhouses  and its two generating units with a new powerhouse  containing a single unit, modifying the project's existing intake  structure, and replacing its controlled overflow spillway. </p><p>3. Article 306 of the July 1, 2010 order required the licensee  to begin construction of that redevelopment  within two years and to complete construction within three years of the order's issuance date. However, the licensee  requested an extension of time on January 27, 2012 seeking to change the construction start date to July 1, 2014, and the construction completion date to July 1, 2017. The Commission approved the extension in an order dated May 1, 2012. <footnote><anchor id="fnote3_13_263_240"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p> Order Granting Extension of Time issued May 1, 2012 (unpublished).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="3" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 600"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf"><emphasis typeStyle="un">License  Requirement</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>4. Article 402 of the license  requires the licensee,  within 60 days of Commission approval of the Operational Compliance Monitoring Plan (required separately under Article 403 of the license) , to release a minimum flow of 300 cubic feet  per second (cfs), or inflow  to the project reservoir  if less, over Shoshone Falls during daylight hours from April 1 through Labor Day to improve the aesthetic qualities of Shoshone Falls. Article 402 also allows this flow to be temporarily  modified  if required by operating emergencies beyond the control of the licensee,  and for short periods upon agreement among the licensee  and the National Park Service (NPS), Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation  (Idaho DPR), and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (Idaho DEQ). If the flow is so modified,  the licensee  shall notify the Commission as soon as possible, but no later than 10 days after each such incident.</p><p>5. In the order amending the license  issued July 1, 2010, the Commission modified  the scenic  flow schedule of Article 402 to require the release of 300 cfs, or project inflows  if less, from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm from April 1 through Labor Day each year. <page number="4" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 600"/> In that same amendment the Commission also required the licensee  to maintain supplemental  aesthetic releases between April 15 and June 16 from 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm on Fridays and from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm on Saturdays, Sundays, and Memorial Day. The supplemental  releases depend on inflows  to the project. These changes to Article 402 were to take effect within 60 days of Commission approval of a Revised  Operational Compliance Monitoring Plan. That revised  plan was originally due on January 2, 2011, however the licensee  has received two extensions of time to file the plan, with the most recent one extending the due date to January 2, 2017. <footnote><anchor id="fnote4_17_354_141"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p> Order Granting Extension of Time issued March 7, 2013 (unpublished).</p></bodyText></footnote> Therefore, the licensee  is currently operating the project under the original Operational Compliance Monitoring Plan approved on May 5, 2005. <footnote><anchor id="fnote5_17_357_139"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p> Order Modifying and Approving Operation Compliance Monitoring Plan Pursuant to Articles 403 and 404 issued May 5, 2005 (<citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C0NM3628T4CN0080000400"><content><span normalizedCite="111 F.E.R.C.

During Phase  I, the licensee  plans to: (1) construct  a scenic  flow structure integral with, and adjacent to, the project's existing intake  structure and Dam  No. 1, and (2) replace the gated spillway  on Dam  No. 4 with a fixed crest concrete overflow spillway.  Other work under Phase  I includes intake  concrete rehabilitation, intake  gate  replacement, and gate  hoist replacement. The licensee  would complete construction of the scenic  flow channel  prior to the placement of the cofferdam associated with the reconstruction of Dam  No. 4. This would allow the licensee  to manage river  flows through the gates  at Dam  No. 4 while allowing the reservoir  level to be maintained below the crest of Dams  No. 1, 2 and 3, which will prevent water from flowing into the construction zone of the scenic  flow channel. </p><p>7. In order to construct  Phase  I, the licensee  is requesting a temporary  variance  to the scenic  flow schedule of Article 402 of the project license.  Specifically, the licensee  requests to temporarily  change the hours of the minimum flow releases of 300 cfs, or the inflow  to the project reservoir  if less, over Shoshone Falls from all daylight hours<page number="6" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 600"/> between April 1st and Labor Day, as currently required, to between 9:00 am and 8:00 pm from April 1, 2014 through September 1, 2014 (Labor Day). This temporary  change would mirror the schedule required under the revised  Article 402 in the July 1, 2010 order. However, that schedule is not yet in effect since the Revised  Operational Compliance Monitoring Plan has not yet been approved and is not due until January 2, 2017.</p><p>8. The licensee  also requests to temporarily  operate at a normal operation reservoir  elevation  of 3353.5 feet  mean sea level (msl)  and at a minimum reservoir  elevation  of 3352.5 feet  msl.  Both levels are one foot  below their normal target elevations  of 3354.5 and 3353.5 feet  msl,  respectively. The licensee  requests the temporary  variance  in reservoir  levels to ensure they can maintain a dewatered and safe construction site, as well as respond to and accommodate abrupt changes in river  flows more effectively.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf"><emphasis typeStyle="un">Consultation</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>9. Prior to filing the temporary  variance  request with the Commission, and pursuant to Article 402 of the license,  the licensee  consulted with the NPS, Idaho DPR, and Idaho DEQ. The licensee  provided the agencies the temporary <page number="7" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 600"/> variance  request via email  on December 19, 2013, and asked the agencies to provide comments by January 21, 2014. The NPS replied  to the licensee  in an email  dated January 22, 2014, saying NPS concurs with the licensee's  proposed plan for Phase  I of the redevelopment  project. Idaho DPR replied  to the licensee  via email  dated January 7, 2014, saying they concur with the variance  as requested and don't see the differences in flows impacting recreation  at the project significantly. Idaho DEQ replied  to the licensee  in an email  dated January 7, 2014, saying the temporary  changes to both the flows and reservoir  elevations  seem reasonable for what is proposed. They said that they have no substantive objections to the request and that from the standpoint of water quality,  incorporating best management practices during the construction phase  would help protect water quality  standards for the Snake River.  The licensee  has submitted an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and a Quality Control Inspection Program as part of their plans and specifications for the Phase  I work. Those plans, which would address best management practices, are being reviewed by the Division of Dam  Safety and Inspections, <page number="8" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 600"/> Portland Regional Office. Idaho DEQ had no additional comments on the variance  request.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf"><emphasis typeStyle="un">Conclusion</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>10. Based on our review of the information provided by the licensee,  agency comments, and staff's independent analysis, we have determined that approving the licensee's  request for a temporary  variance  to the scenic  flow schedule of Article 402 between April 1, 2014, and September 1, 2014 (Labor Day) and the temporary  lowering of the normal minimum and maximum operating reservoir  levels by one foot  between April 1, 2014, and September 1, 2014, would not adversely affect recreation  at the project, water quality,  or scenic  flows over Shoshone Falls. Accordingly, this order approves the licensee's  temporary  variance  request.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="un">The Director orders</emphasis>:</p><p>(A) Idaho Power Company's request pursuant to Article 402 for a temporary   variance  to the scenic  flow schedule requirements for Shoshone Falls and to the normal reservoir  operating and minimal elevations  filed on January 31, 2014, as modified  by paragraph (B), is approved.</p><p>(B) This order constitutes final agency action.
