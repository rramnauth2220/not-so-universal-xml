Order No. 1000 also required that each cost allocation method adhere to six cost allocation principles.</p><p>5.

The Commission denied the motion, holding that it was the Commission's intent, in accepting the Filing Parties' proposed October 1, 2013 effective date, that Filing Parties would implement their proposed Attachment K revisions  accepted therein together with the further tariff revisions  Filing Parties submitted<page number="7" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> in their September 16, 2013 compliance filings in response to the First Compliance Order. <footnote><anchor id="fnote7_22_1066_93"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p><citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C0WP5328T4D400R0000400"><content>PacifiCorp, <span normalizedCite="145 F.E.R.C.

Given that Order No. 1000 did not require non-public utility transmission providers  that wish to enroll in an Order No. 1000 regional transmission planning process  to have a reciprocity OATT on file with the Commission, we find that non-public utility transmission providers  should be able, if they wish, to enroll as Full Funders without having to file a reciprocity OATT with the Commission. Some requirements for enrollment, such as a publicly available transmission  tariff, may be appropriate in order to provide greater transparency about how the regional transmission planning  and cost allocation processes will be implemented, given the participation of non-public utility transmission providers  without reciprocity OATTs on file with the Commission. That said, we find that the requirement for a non-public utility transmission provider  to have a Commission-approved reciprocity OATT to enroll in the NTTG transmission planning region  as a Full Funder is overly burdensome because it would prevent a non-public<page number="25" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> utility transmission provider  from enrolling in the region  even if that non-public utility transmission provider  otherwise provides comparable transmission  service to public utility transmission providers  in the region  through a tariff or other agreement that is not filed with the Commission. Accordingly, we direct Filing Parties to submit, within 60 days of the date of issuance of this order, further compliance filings to revise  the enrollment process in their respective OATTs to eliminate this requirement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">b. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Order No. 890 and Other Regional   Transmission   Planning Process  General Requirements</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>26.

The Commission therefore directed Filing Parties to revise  their OATTs to address the collection and exchange of relevant information, such as customer load  forecasts, projected service information, and existing and planned demand response resources provided by customers and stakeholders,  for use in developing the regional transmission  plan. <footnote><anchor id="fnote46_95_2842_11"/><label>46</label><bodyText><p><citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C0WP5328T4D403M0000400"><content><span normalizedCite="143 F.E.R.C.

The Commission found that Filing Parties' first compliance filings partially complied  with the comparability principle, as they (1) identified where and when stakeholders  may propose alternatives, (2) stated that all stakeholder  submissions will be evaluated  on a comparable basis, and (3) committed each Filing Party to use its best efforts<page number="29" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> to facilitate the NTTG region  conducting its regional  process, using identified regional transmission  and non-transmission alternatives, to identify regional transmission  projects (if any) that are more efficient and cost-effective  from a regional  perspective than the transmission  projects identified in Filing Parties' local transmission  plans. However, the Commission directed Filing Parties to revise  their OATTs to address the requirement that the NTTG regional transmission planning process,  after considering the data and comments supplied by customers and other stakeholders,  develop a transmission  system plan that meets the specific service requests of transmission  customers and otherwise treats similarly-situated customers (e.g., network and retail native load)  comparably in the transmission  system planning.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote47_97_2937_5"/><label>47</label><bodyText><p><citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C0WP5328T4D403P0000400"><content><span normalizedCite="143 F.E.R.C.

We find that Filing Parties' proposed revisions  partially comply with the directives  in the First Compliance Order regarding the affirmative obligation to plan. We accept Filing Parties' revisions  that affirmatively state that the Planning  Committee will analyze the regional  transmission  needs submitted in quarter 1 of the regional  transmission  planning  cycle  to identify more efficient or cost-effective  transmission  solutions for the NTTG footprint. Similarly, we accept Filing Parties' description of the Biennial Study Plan as the mechanism through which the regional  transmission  planning process  will be performed. We find that this regional  transmission  planning process  structure complies with Order No. 1000. Specifically, we find that these OATT revisions  address in part the First Compliance Order's directive  that Filing Parties explain<page number="50" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> how they satisfy Order No. 1000's affirmative obligation to plan. The proposed OATT revisions  also help provide certainty and transparency for stakeholders  by more fully explaining the development of, and contents of, the Biennial Study Plan.</p><p>53. As discussed in the First Compliance Order, Order No. 1000 requires that Filing Parties participate in a regional transmission planning process  that conducts a regional  analysis to identify whether there are more efficient or cost-effective transmission  solutions to regional transmission  needs, including an affirmative obligation to analyze whether such transmission  solutions exist regardless of whether potential transmission  solutions have been proposed by transmission developers  or stakeholders.  Filing Parties' respective OATTs indicate that (1) the NTTG regional transmission planning process  will conduct its own analysis to identify more efficient or cost-effective transmission  solutions, including the development of unsponsored transmission  projects that may be selected in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation, <footnote><anchor id="fnote82_162_4596_60"/><label>82</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K §§ 3.7.3.2, 3.7.4.1.</p></bodyText></footnote> and (2) the NTTG transmission planning region  will use a regional  perspective to consider unsponsored <page number="51" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/>transmission  projects generated through regional  analysis. <footnote><anchor id="fnote83_162_4619_61"/><label>83</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g., id</emphasis>.§ 3.3.2.</p></bodyText></footnote> Filing Parties' proposal also states that the Planning  Committee may propose its own unsponsored transmission  projects in quarter 1 of the regional transmission planning process  at the same time that transmission developers  and stakeholders  may propose transmission  projects for possible selection in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation. <footnote><anchor id="fnote84_162_4655_56"/><label>84</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp Transmittal Letter at 8; PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K§ 3.7.3.2.</p></bodyText></footnote> However, the Planning  Committee does not perform a regional  analysis or evaluation of transmission  projects to determine the more efficient or cost-effective transmission  solution to regional transmission  needs until quarters 3 and 4. Thus, it is unclear, based on the proposed tariff revisions,  whether, and if so, how the NTTG regional transmission planning process  will perform an analysis during quarter 1 that could result in the identification of unsponsored transmission  projects that the Planning  Committee may then propose for regional  cost allocation or whether the Planning  Committee will identify unsponsored transmission  projects through the regional  analysis performed during quarters 3 and 4 that it will then propose during quarter 1 of the subsequent<page number="52" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/>transmission planning cycle.  Thus, Filing Parties must make further revisions  to their OATTs to explain how and when the Planning  Committee will perform the regional  analysis through which it will identify any unsponsored transmission  projects that it proposes during quarter 1 of the regional transmission planning process.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote85_162_4748_4"/><label>85</label><bodyText><p> In complying with this directive,  Filing Parties may want to expand upon information previously included in the Practice Document, in which they explain at a high level the study process in quarters 3 and 4.

Filing Parties also assert that a minimum tangible net worth of $ 1 million demonstrates that the transmission developer  has working capital to undertake the significant permitting required for<page number="106" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> a transmission  project. Finally, Filing Parties contend that if a transmission developer  has total assets of $ 10 million, this asset level is roughly similar to the level of assets of a very small utility, and therefore is representative of the level of assets that could support the construction and/or operation of a transmission  project. <footnote><anchor id="fnote178_333_9209_15"/><label>178</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp Transmittal Letter at 16.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>105.

In response to the Commission's directive  to either provide justification for Filing Parties proposed alternative to an investment grade credit rating or to propose and justify another alternative, Filing Parties have revised  their proposal to retain two of the three required alternative demonstrations <footnote><anchor id="fnote192_359_9820_119"/><label>192</label><bodyText><p> Filing Parties originally proposed to require that a transmission  developer  demonstrate that it has an investment grade credit rating or, in the alternative, to demonstrate that: (1) it or its parent company has existed for at least five years; (2) its working capital has been positive for the prior three years; and (3) its assets are at least five times the transmission  project's capital costs. <citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C1GBCB0K1MYF0030000400"><content>First Compliance Order, <span normalizedCite="143 F.E.R.C.

We note that the development and construction of transmission  projects requires a significant financial investment; therefore, it is not unreasonable to require some assurance that the transmission developer  will have the financial assets necessary to complete the project. This proposed alternative to an investment grade credit rating is fair, not unreasonably stringent, or unduly discriminatory or preferential and provides each transmission developer  with the opportunity to demonstrate that it has the necessary financial resources to develop, construct, own, operate, and maintain transmission  facilities. Therefore, we find that this revision  is reasonably related to the transmission developer's  financial ability to undertake a transmission  project and, accordingly, we accept this revised  requirement.</p><p><page number="117" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/></p><p>114. However, we continue to find that Filing Parties have failed to justify their proposed financial qualification  criterion  that requires a transmission  developer  to demonstrate in lieu of showing that it has an investment grade credit rating that it or its parent company has been in existence for five years and has had positive working capital for the past three years. Filing Parties contend that the five year requirement corresponds to a reasonable time to plan a transmission  project and that three prior years of positive working capital indicate the stability of a transmission  developer's  access to capital. We find that Filing Parties have offered no evidence to support the correlations they assert. More importantly, we find that requiring these two demonstrations would needlessly restrict the pool of qualified transmission  developers  to companies that are at least five years old. Such a requirement would preclude otherwise well-qualified transmission  developers  that could rely on the technical expertise of third parties to construct and operate a transmission  project and that are well-capitalized and have ready access to capital markets from proposing transmission  projects<page number="118" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> for selection in the regional  transmission  plan. Thus, Filing Parties' proposal to require these two alternative demonstrations unduly restricts newly-formed companies from proposing transmission  projects in the regional  transmission  planning process,  regardless of their financial ability to undertake a transmission  project. Accordingly, we direct Filing Parties to submit, within 60 days of the date of issuance of this order, further compliance filings that revise  their respective OATTs to remove these alternative demonstrations.</p><p>115.

However, Filing Parties explain that the Planning  Committee may consider the incomplete data in its consideration of whether to include an unsponsored  project that resembles the withdrawn submission. Filing Parties state that during the next regional transmission planning cycle,  the transmission developer  may resubmit its respective transmission  project, with updated information and remedied data deficiencies, for consideration in the regional transmission  plan and may request cost allocation consideration. <footnote><anchor id="fnote206_385_10704_58"/><label>206</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp Transmittal Letter at 17-18; PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K § 3.7.2.6.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>123.

Filing Parties have revised  the description of the additional information in their respective OATTs and have conformed the Cost Allocation Data Form to the description in their respective OATTs to state that transmission developers  "are encouraged but not required to also provide" the following information: (a) a statement as to whether the project was selected in a transmission provider's  local plan; (b) a statement as to whether the proposed project is planned in conjunction with evaluation of economical resource development and operation (i.e., as part on an integrated resource planning process  or other resource planning process  regarding economical operation of current or future resources) conducted by or for one or more load  serving entities  within the footprint of a transmission provider;  (c) copies of all studies upon which planning  of the project is based, if the proposed project is planned primarily to meet the transmission  needs of a reliability  or public policy  requirement of a transmission provider;  (d) copies of all studies upon which planning  of the project is based, including, but not limited to, any production<page number="129" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> cost model input and output used as part of the economic justification of the project, if the proposed project is planned as part of future resource development and operation within the footprint of a local transmission provider;  (e) copies of all studies performed by or in possession of the Applicant that describe and/or quantify the estimated annual impacts (both beneficial and detrimental) of the proposed project on the Applicant and other regional entities;  (f) copies of any WECC or other regional,  interregional, or interconnection-wide planning entity  determinations relative to the project; (g) the input assumptions and the range of forecasts incorporated in any studies the transmission developer  relied upon in evaluating the efficiency or cost-effectiveness of the proposed project; and (h) any proposal the transmission developer  the Applicant may choose to offer addressing treatment of project cost overruns. <footnote><anchor id="fnote207_387_10824_87"/><label>207</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp Transmittal Letter at 17-18; PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K § 3.7.2.3(a) - (h).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="130" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">iii. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Commission Determination</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>124. We find that the provisions in Filing Parties' filing addressing information requirements partially comply with the directives  in the First Compliance Order. Filing Parties clarify the load  and resource data that both incumbent transmission  developers  and nonincumbent transmission  developers  must provide, as well as the information that a transmission  developer  must provide to satisfy the "economic consideration" requirement for a proposed transmission  project, complying with the Commission's directives  in the First Compliance Order. Filing Parties' revised  OATTs also clarify that the NTTG Planning  Committee and Cost Allocation Committee will be responsible for determining whether a transmission  developer  has satisfied the region's  information requirements, will notify the transmission  developer  of the deficiencies, and will attempt to remedy deficiencies in the submitted information through informal communications. Therefore, we find that Filing Parties comply with the Commission's directive  in the First Compliance Order that Filing Parties explain whether the NTTG Planning  Committee or the public utility  transmission  providers  in<page number="131" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> the transmission  planning  region  determine what data and other information elements are deemed appropriate for consideration of proposed transmission  projects. Furthermore, the Filing Parties have responded to our concern regarding the requirement that various studies, data, and assumptions be provided by the prospective transmission  developer  for a proposed transmission  project to be considered in the regional  transmission  plan by revising their OATTs to provide that the transmission  developer  may submit these studies and information on a voluntarily basis. Thus, Filing Parties have resolved the Commission's concern that these information requirements could effectively prohibit transmission  developers  from proposing transmission  projects.</p><p>125. However, we direct Filing Parties to make a clarifying edit to their procedures governing the proposal of transmission  projects for consideration in the regional transmission planning process,  to ensure that stakeholders  may submit ideas into the regional transmission planning process  without being required to provide the full scope of information that Filing Parties propose to require for sponsored and unsponsored transmission  project<page number="132" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> proposals. Filing Parties propose that a "stakeholder  may submit an unsponsored  project for consideration in the Regional Transmission  Plan by submitting to the Planning  Committee chair the information identified in the 'Unsponsored  Project' column of Table 2" in their respective OATTs. <footnote><anchor id="fnote208_391_11004_134"/><label>208</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K § 3.7.2.2.</p></bodyText></footnote> Our review indicates that these information requirements placed upon the stakeholder  are the same as those required for transmission developers  that propose a transmission  project for consideration in the regional transmission  plan.

The displacement of a transmission  project in the initial regional transmission  plan may be due to a Change Case or due to a determination that more than one transmission  project in the initial regional transmission  plan is meeting the same transmission  need. The proposal also states that this benefit metric also captures the extent to which a Change Case may displace one or more transmission  projects in the initial<page number="141" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/>regional transmission  plan for purposes of meeting public policy  requirements because it is determined to have lower capital-related costs, while still meeting the same public policy  requirements. Capital-related costs will be calculated as the sum of annual return (both debt and equity related), depreciation, taxes other than income, operation and maintenance expense, and income taxes. These costs will be based on estimates provided by the transmission developer  or, if the transmission developer  does not provide estimates, estimates by the Planning  Committee using representative industry data, and power flow analysis will be used to ensure that each scenario  meets transmission reliability  standards.

According<page number="143" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> to Filing Parties' proposed revisions,  the reserves metric is based on savings that may result when two or more balancing authority areas could economically share a reserve resource when unused transmission  capacity remains in a proposed transmission  project. The proposed language states that a change in annual reserves between a Change Case and the initial regional transmission  plan measures the energy impact of changing transmission  projects within the initial regional transmission  plan with one or more transmission  projects in the Change Case.

It also claims that proponents of local projects should be required to identify the treatment of project cost overruns in the local transmission  plan, so that an "apples to apples" project comparison can be made in the regional transmission  plan. <footnote><anchor id="fnote235_434_12121_12"/><label>235</label><bodyText><p> LS Power Protest at 6-7.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="148" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/></p><p>138. LS Power also challenges Filing Parties' proposed definition of "Initial Regional  Plan," which is defined to include projects included in the prior NTTG regional transmission  plan and projects included in local transmission  plans of Full Funders. <footnote><anchor id="fnote236_436_12141_75"/><label>236</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">See</emphasis> section III.B.2.a.ii (Transmission   Planning   Region)  above for the definition of "Full Funder."</p></bodyText></footnote> LS Power argues that the definition of "Local Transmission  System Plan or Local Transmission  Plan" may allow transmission  projects beyond those that meet the definition of "local" in Order No. 1000, and asserts that it would be inappropriate to include any "local" transmission  project in the "Initial Regional  Plan" that expands beyond the Order No. 1000 definition of "local" transmission  projects. LS Power seeks confirmation that the scope of transmission  projects that will be included in their local transmission  plans, and thus form the Initial Regional  Plan, will include only those projects that meet Order No. 1000's definition of "local." LS Power argues that the local transmission  plan should be reserved only for those transmission  projects within a single transmission provider's  retail distribution service territory or footprint and for which the costs are borne exclusively by the customers of the transmission provider. <page number="149" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> LS Power further argues that its concern is enhanced by the "local" cost allocation provisions of Filing Parties' OATTs, which purport to apply to transmission  projects that extend beyond individual Filing Parties' respective balancing authority areas and are owned by multiple transmission  owners. LS Power asks the Commission to require Filing Parties to amend their OATTs to confine local transmission planning  to local transmission  projects as defined under Order No. 1000. <footnote><anchor id="fnote237_436_12203_48"/><label>237</label><bodyText><p> LS Power Protest at 3-4.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">iv. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Answer</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>139.

The Commission found that Filing Parties had failed to justify this proposal in the circumstances<page number="161" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> in which an incumbent transmission provider's reliability  needs or service obligations would go unmet if an alternative solution failed to satisfy the threshold.

The Commission found that Filing Parties' compliance filings partially complied  with Order No. 1000's Regional  Cost Allocation Principles. First, the Commission found that Filing Parties generally met the Order No. 1000 requirement that each public utility transmission provider  have in place a method, or set of methods, for allocating the costs of new<page number="177" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/>transmission  facilities selected in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation. The Commission found that Filing Parties' proposal to identify beneficiaries  and measure benefits of a transmission  facility selected in the regional transmission  plan based on the resulting changes in energy losses and reserves complied  with Regional  Cost Allocation Principle 1, as that approach allocates the costs in a manner that is at least roughly commensurate with the benefits the transmission  facility provides. However, the Commission found that Filing Parties had not properly defined their third benefit metric -- changes in annual capital-related costs -- in order for the Commission to determine whether that metric complied  with Regional  Cost Allocation Principle 1. Therefore, the Commission directed Filing Parties to describe this proposed benefit metric in greater detail and explain how it allocates costs of a transmission  facility selected in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation in a manner that is at least roughly commensurate with the benefits that facility provides. <footnote><anchor id="fnote294_538_14420_135"/><label>294</label><bodyText><p><citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C1GC880K1NB90020000400"><content>First Compliance Order, <span normalizedCite="143 F.E.R.C.

The Commission also found that Filing Parties' proposal to allocate the costs of transmission  projects selected in the regional   transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation to beneficiaries  in proportion to the value of adjusted net benefits that they receive from a transmission  project complied  with Regional  Cost Allocation Principle 1. However, the Commission raised concerns with some aspects of the Filing Parties' proposed adjustment of the net benefits used to calculate those proportions. To arrive at the adjusted net benefits, Filing Parties proposed to adjust the net initial benefits for a regional   beneficiary  using the following criteria:<excerpt><bodyText><p>(1) The net benefits attributed in any scenario  are capped at 150 percent of the average of the unadjusted net benefits across all allocation scenarios; <br/>(2) If the average of the net benefits, as adjusted by (1) above, across the allocation scenarios  is negative, the average net benefit to that beneficiary  is set to zero; and<br/>(3) Based on the net benefits, as adjusted by (1) and (2) above, across the allocation scenarios,  if the ratio of the standard deviation to the average is greater than 1.0, the average net benefit<page number="179" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> to that beneficiary  is set to zero.</p></bodyText></excerpt>Filing Parties then proposed that each of these adjustments be applied to each regional beneficiary  independent of other beneficiaries,  and that beneficiaries  other than the transmission developer  be allocated  costs such that the ratio of adjusted net benefits to allocated  costs is no less than 1.1. The Commission found that Filing Parties' proposal to impose a cap on positive outlying benefits, but not on negative outlying benefits, increased the likelihood that the adjusted average net benefits across the allocation scenarios  would be negative. As a result, the average net benefit for that beneficiary  would be set to zero and the benefit-to-cost ratio for beneficiaries  other than the transmission developer  would be less than 1.1. The Commission concluded that limiting expected benefits in this manner would not result in an allocation of costs that is roughly commensurate with benefits received and, therefore, absent justification, rejected Filing Parties' proposed 150 percent cap. Because the Commission rejected this cap, it directed Filing Parties to provide justification regarding the second and third adjustment criteria. In particular, <page number="180" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> the Commission expressed concern that, under Filing Parties' proposal, the average net benefits to a beneficiary  would be set to zero such that the beneficiary  would not be allocated  costs if the ratio of the standard deviation to the average of the net benefits across the allocation scenarios  is greater than 1.0, even if the average net benefits are always positive. The Commission concluded that such a result does not allocate costs in a manner that is roughly commensurate with benefits because an identified beneficiary  with positive net benefits in all scenarios  would not be allocated  any costs. Thus, the Commission required Filing Parties to justify this aspect of their proposal. <footnote><anchor id="fnote295_540_14560_104"/><label>295</label><bodyText><p><citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C0WP5328T4D40VN0000400"><content><span normalizedCite="143 F.E.R.C.

Filing Parties have proposed revisions  to their procedures for adjusting the calculated initial net benefits for each identified beneficiary  to determine whether a transmission  project will be selected in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation. Filing Parties propose to use the following two revised  criteria: (1) the net benefits attributed in any scenario  are capped at no less than 50 percent and no more than 150 percent of the average of the unadjusted, net benefits (whether positive or negative), and (2) if<page number="188" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> the average of the net benefits, as adjusted above, across the allocation scenarios  is negative, the average net benefit to that beneficiary  is set to zero. <footnote><anchor id="fnote307_562_15211_46"/><label>307</label><bodyText><p> Filing Parties further explain that they have eliminated the previous third criterion,  which set the average net benefit to a beneficiary  to zero if the ratio of the standard deviation to the average of the net benefits across the allocation scenarios  is greater than 1.0 if the entire range of benefits is positive. <emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g., </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle="it">id</emphasis>. at 23.</p></bodyText></footnote> In support of the first criterion,  Filing Parties explain that they have modified the previous 150 percent cap criterion,  which was originally proposed for the purpose of removing outlying cost allocation scenario  values to prevent the outliers from skewing the benefit calculation. This cap will apply at 50 percent and 150 percent increments, which will address both positive and negative cost allocation scenarios.  In addition, according to Filing Parties, the proposed revision  also eliminates the likelihood that the adjusted average net benefits across the allocation scenarios  will be negative in order to address the Commission's concern that application of the 150 percent cap criterion  would result in an allocation of costs that is not roughly commensurate with benefits received.</p><p><page number="189" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/></p><p>179. With respect to the second criterion,  Filing Parties explain that they propose to retain it because it operates to ensure that a beneficiary  with negative impacts from a project would not be allocated  any costs and would not be able to recover damages for any impacts from other beneficiaries  or the transmission developer,  if any. Filing Parties argue that if this criterion  is not included and net losses are included in the cost allocation, the costs allocated  to other beneficiaries  with positive net benefits would be overstated, potentially in violation of the roughly commensurate principle. <footnote><anchor id="fnote308_564_15281_118"/><label>308</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g., </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle="it">id</emphasis>. at 22-23; PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K § 3.8.2.2.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>180.

Filing Parties provide additional detail regarding the use of allocation scenarios  in calculating the costs and benefits of a transmission  project proposed for selection in the regional   transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation. They explain that the Cost Allocation Committee, in consultation with the Planning  Committee and with stakeholder  input, creates allocation scenarios  in quarters<page number="192" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> 1 and 2 of the regional   transmission   planning   cycle  for those parameters that likely affect the amount of total benefits of a transmission  project and their distribution among beneficiaries  for inclusion in the Biennial Study Plan. Filing Parties propose to revise  their respective OATTs to explain that:<excerpt><bodyText><p>the variables in the allocation scenarios  will include, but are not limited to, load  levels by load-serving entity  and geographic location, fuel prices, and fuel and resource availability. For example, cost allocation scenarios  could include a range of future load  levels. Future projections of load  levels in a given scenario  will be based on factors such as, but not limited to, projected demand for irrigation, economic development, and heating/cooling demands necessitated by weather forecasts in particular geographic locations. These load  level projections will be compared against a range of future resource options. Future projections of resource options in a given scenario  will be based on factors such as, but not limited to, projected fuel prices and projected yields of particular types of generation resources (e.g., wind, hydro, etc.). This process will provide the overall range<page number="193" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> of future cost allocation scenarios  that will be used in determining a project's benefits and beneficiaries.  In the development of the allocation scenarios  the Cost Allocation Committee will give consideration to alternative resource planning scenarios  developed by transmission providers  within the NTTG Footprint as well as scenarios  developed by other regional  and Western Interconnection entities.  <footnote><anchor id="fnote312_571_15520_5"/><label>312</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K § 3.8.2.3.</p></bodyText></footnote></p></bodyText></excerpt>Filing Parties further propose to revise  their respective OATTs to state that because estimates of the amount and distribution of benefits may be highly uncertain and dependent upon key assumptions and projections, the potential impact of these uncertainties is estimated and incorporated in the calculation of net benefits used in cost allocation through the use of scenarios  that choose data across a range of outcomes for these parameters. <footnote><anchor id="fnote313_571_15529_72"/><label>313</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp Transmittal Letter at 25-26; PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K § 3.8.2.3.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>183. <page number="194" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> Filing Parties also propose to revise  their respective OATTs to identify the consequences of a transmission  facility being selected in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation for other transmission planning regions.  Filing Parties explain that the Planning  Committee will monitor the impacts of transmission  projects under consideration for the draft regional transmission  plan on neighboring transmission planning regions.  Under the proposal, the Planning  Committee will first identify the most efficient or cost-effective transmission  plan (either the initial transmission  plan or a Change Case) prior to consideration of the impacts on neighboring transmission planning regions;  however, if the Planning  Committee finds that the initial transmission  plan or Change Case may cause reliability  standard violations on neighboring transmission planning regions,  the Planning  Committee will coordinate with the neighboring transmission planning regions  to reassess and redesign the facilities. If the violation of reliability  standards can be mitigated through new or redesigned facilities or facility upgrades within the NTTG footprint or through operational adjustments within<page number="195" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> the NTTG footprint, the cost of the mitigation solutions will be considered in addition to the cost of the transmission  project(s) under consideration. If the reliability  standard violation cannot be mitigated (by actions within the NTTG footprint or the affected neighboring transmission planning region) , the Change Case or initial transmission  plan will not be selected for the draft regional transmission  plan. According to Filing Parties, the impacts of upgrades on, or additions to, the neighboring transmission planning regions,  whether identified by the Planning  Committee or neighboring transmission planning regions,  will be considered by the Planning  Committee, provided, however, that any costs associated with such impacts in the neighboring transmission planning regions  will not be accepted for regional  cost allocation, and will not be considered when selecting a transmission  project for the draft regional transmission  plan. <footnote><anchor id="fnote314_575_15715_12"/><label>314</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp Transmittal Letter at 26-27; PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K § 3.7.4.3.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="196" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/></p><p>184.

We find that Filing Parties' proposal to cap net benefits at no less than 50 percent and no more than 150 percent of the adjusted net benefits (whether positive or negative) is an acceptable approach to eliminate both outlying positive and negative benefit calculations, and therefore addresses the flaw in Filing Parties' prior proposal that only applied such adjustment to outlying positive calculations. Similarly, we accept Filing Parties' proposal to set a beneficiary's  net benefits to zero if the average net benefits, following the previously-discussed adjustment, are negative, as well as Filing Parties' proposal to eliminate the third adjustment criterion  proposed in their initial Order No. 1000 compliance filings. <footnote><anchor id="fnote326_598_16198_87"/><label>326</label><bodyText><p> This criterion  would have set a beneficiary's  average net benefit to zero if the ratio of the standard deviation to the average net benefits, as adjusted by outlying benefit adjustment and negative average net benefit adjustment, is greater than 1.0. <citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C1GCPT2202680010000400"><content>First Compliance Order, <span normalizedCite="143 F.E.R.C.

Filing Parties also propose to revise  other threshold criteria that will apply to determine whether a transmission  project is eligible for selection in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost<page number="214" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> allocation. First, they propose to eliminate the criterion  that a proposed transmission  project must have total estimated project benefits to regional entities  other than the transmission developer  which exceed $ 10 million. Second, Filing Parties propose to revise  the minimum cost threshold for a transmission  project that is eligible for regional  cost allocation to $ 20 million, which Filing Parties assert provides a reasonable balance between managing the administrative requirements imposed on NTTG members in preparing a cost allocation for a transmission  project, regardless of size, and the likelihood that a project costing less than $ 20 million will span multiple transmission providers,  require sharing of its cost across multiple entities  in order to be constructed, and/or provide substantial benefits to multiple entities.  Accordingly, to be eligible for selection in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation, a transmission  project must (1) fall into one of the three categories of projects identified above, (2) be selected in the draft regional transmission  plan, and (3) have an estimated cost exceeding $ 20 million. <footnote><anchor id="fnote343_628_16987_67"/><label>343</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle="it">E.g</emphasis>., PacifiCorp Transmittal Letter at 28; PacifiCorp OATT, Attachment K § 3.8.2.1.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p><page number="215" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">iii. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Commission Determination</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>201. We find that Filing Parties' proposed revisions  to their respective OATT provisions governing which transmission  projects are eligible for regional  cost allocation comply with the Commission's directives  in the First Compliance Order. First, Filing Parties' revised  OATTs clearly state that a stakeholder  may propose a transmission  project for selection in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation and need not satisfy Filing Parties' proposed qualification  criteria if the stakeholder  does not intend to sponsor the project. Second, we accept Filing Parties' proposals to (1) eliminate the requirement that, to be eligible to be selected in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation, a transmission  project must provide at least $ 10 million in benefits to regional entities  other than the project's sponsor, and (2) revise  the region's  minimum cost threshold requirement to $ 20 million.

In the First Compliance Order, the Commission rejected Filing Parties' proposal to provide transmission providers  whose transmission  projects have been deferred or replaced, ownership or ownership-like rights on the alternative transmission  project or on the transmission  system within which the alternative transmission  project is embedded. The Commission found that the proposal appeared to require a transmission developer  to relinquish a portion, if not all, of its ownership stake in its transmission  project, which would be a disincentive to nonincumbent transmission developers  to propose transmission  projects for selection in the regional transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation. The Commission noted, however, that Filing Parties may submit a revised  proposal that addresses access to new transmission  facilities for which an entity  has been allocated  costs pursuant to a regional  cost allocation method, but such a proposal should not require a transmission developer  to grant ownership in, or ownership-like rights to, its transmission  project. <footnote><anchor id="fnote345_635_17174_15"/><label>345</label><bodyText><p><citation type="agencyDecision" id="I5C1GD100K1NN70020000400"><content>First Compliance Order, <span normalizedCite="143 F.E.R.C.

We also conditionally accept Filing Parties' proposal to identify and provide with the cost allocation for a transmission  project selected in the regional   transmission  plan for purposes of cost allocation, the transmission  rights or ownership-like rights that were assumed would be available to and utilized by beneficiaries  to realize their benefits from the transmission  project. We agree that<page number="219" pageScheme="2014 FERC LEXIS 621"/> such information can be useful to beneficiaries  and transmission   developers.  However, Filing Parties' proposal does not adequately explain what "ownership-like rights" are, and therefore what rights may be assumed to underlie benefit determinations in the regional   transmission   planning process.  Accordingly, we direct Filing Parties to submit, within 60 days of the date of issuance of this order, further compliance filings that revise  their respective OATTs to explain what "ownership-like rights" are and to provide additional detail regarding what "ownership-like rights" may be assumed as part of the regional   transmission   planning process. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">5. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Conforming Edits</emphasis></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle="bf">a. <emphasis typeStyle="un">Summary of Compliance Filings</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>206.
